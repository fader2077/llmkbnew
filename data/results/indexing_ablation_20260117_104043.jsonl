This reflects their superior adaptation to hot and humid environments. In contrast, imported goats and their crossbreds tend to retain stronger short-day breeding characteristics, with reduced estrus expression and conception rates during the non-breeding season. However, in recent years, climate change has intensified heat stress, making seasonal differences in reproductive performance increasingly evident.
