1. **Rumination**: Goats regurgitate food (cud) to chew it more thoroughly, which helps break down tough plant fibers.

2. **Multi-Chambered Stomach**:
   - **Rumen**: The first chamber where feed is stored and mixed with bacteria that ferment and break down cellulose.
   - **Reticulum**: A second chamber that further processes the food, filtering out foreign objects.
   - **Omasum**: A third chamber that absorbs water and nutrients, preparing the digestate for final digestion.

Here's how it works:

1. **Four-Chambered Stomach**: The stomach consists of four chambers: rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. This structure allows goats to digest fibrous plant material effectively.

2. **Rumen Function**: The rumen is the largest chamber and serves as a fermentation tank. It contains microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa) that break down high-fiber feeds into monosaccharides (sugars). These microbes also convert protein and amino acids into microbial protein, which the goat later digests.

3. **Regurgitation and Chewing**: After initial ingestion, undigested food particles form a bolus in the rumen. This bolus is regurgitated and chewed again by the goat to mix with saliva, aiding further breakdown.

4. **Omasum and Abomasum**: The omasum processes the remaining material, removing water and some nutrients. The abomasum functions similarly to the human stomach, using gastric acid to break down proteins into peptides and amino acids, which are then absorbed in the small intestine.

This digestive process allows goats to efficiently utilize a wide range of feed materials, particularly fibrous ones, by leveraging microbial fermentation and subsequent enzymatic digestion.",0.11180124223602485,0.7747984977328395,10,6791.083900025114
