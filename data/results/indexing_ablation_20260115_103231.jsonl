Goats become infected when they ingest mites containing infective larvae during grazing. Oribatid mites are commonly found in moist pasture and surface soil, making environmental conditions a major risk factor.

High fiber does not always mean adequate nutrition.", "predicted_answer": "Excessive dietary fiber in the diet of goats and sheep can lead to several digestive issues, primarily due to its fermentation process in the rumen. The primary problem is bloat, which occurs when gases become trapped in the rumen, leading to discomfort, bloating, and potentially fatal complications if untreated. This issue arises because high-fiber foods, such as rich forage, can ferment slowly, producing gases that accumulate without being expelled effectively. Additionally, excessive fiber might slow down digestion, reducing nutrient absorption efficiency and possibly decreasing overall feed intake.

Here's a structured explanation:\n\n1. **Body Prioritization**: The body allocates nutrients to critical processes necessary for survival and reproduction before directing them towards growth. This hierarchy ensures that vital functions are maintained even when resources are limited.\n\n2. **Reproductive Demands**: Reproduction involves numerous physiological processes, including pregnancy, placenta formation, fetal development, and lactation, all of which are highly energy-intensive and nutrient-dependent. A deficiency in key nutrients like vitamins (A, D, E) and minerals (iodine, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, selenium) can lead to severe reproductive issues such as reduced fertility, increased susceptibility to diseases, and metabolic disorders.\n\n3. **Impact on Health**: Nutritional deficiencies can cause specific health problems that directly affect reproductive success.

However, some proteins bypass this process and reach the abomasum as undigested material.\n\n2. **Bypass Protein Importance**:\n   - Bypass proteins are crucial for meeting the animal's amino acid requirements beyond what rumen microbes can provide.\n   - These proteins contribute to essential amino acids like lysine and methionine, which are vital for milk production in dairy animals.\n\n3. **Ammonia Levels**:\n   - Excessive ammonia from undigested protein can negatively impact feed intake and efficiency, highlighting the need to balance digestible and bypass proteins.\n\n4. **Essential Amino Acids**:\n   - The availability of essential amino acids is critical for productivity.

The fetus undergoes rapid growth during this period, particularly in terms of muscle development and fat deposition, which increases the ewe's metabolic needs.\n\n2. **Reduced Feed Intake**: As ewes near term, their physical size can limit their ability to consume large quantities of feed.
