In goats, fetal growth during late gestation is highly sensitive to short-term fluctuations in maternal energy and protein availability.

In goats, excessive dietary fiber increases rumen fill and limits energy availability, creating a sustained marginal negative energy balance. Over time, this chronic energy constraint suppresses reproductive endocrine signaling, reducing gonadotropin release and ovarian activity even in the absence of overt body condition loss. Because this process develops slowly, reproductive efficiency declines progressively rather than abruptly. Therefore, nutritional management should evaluate long-term energy density and digestibility, rather than relying solely on forage quantity or short-term intake observations.", "predicted_answer": "The decline in reproductive efficiency among breeding does fed a high-forage diet can be attributed to a deficiency in essential nutrients, particularly vitamins A and E. These vitamins are crucial for maintaining uterine function and overall reproductive health. High-forage diets, especially when relying on imported hay like pennisetum or bermuda grass, may not provide adequate levels of these vitamins. Vitamin A is vital as it supports proper uterine function and fertility, and its deficiency can lead to reduced reproductive success.

In goats, fetal growth during late gestation is highly sensitive to short-term fluctuations in maternal energy and protein availability.
