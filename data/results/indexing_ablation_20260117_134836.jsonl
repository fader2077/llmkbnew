Nutritional deficiencies, particularly of vitamins and minerals necessary for hormone synthesis, can impair this regulation, leading to reproductive issues like anestrus (cessation of cycling).\n\n3. **Prioritization of Essential Functions**: During nutritional stress, the body prioritizes survival over non-essential functions. Reproduction, being closely tied to hormonal balance and energy expenditure, is often suspended through mechanisms like anestrus, ensuring resources are allocated to immediate survival needs.\n\n4. **Impact on Fetal Development**: Nutritional deficiencies can impair organ formation and growth in fetuses, affecting their development more critically than general growth, which might be more adaptable or have a longer recovery period.\n\nIn summary, reproduction is more sensitive to nutritional deficiencies because it involves high energy expenditure, complex hormonal regulation, and immediate consequences of nutrient shortages.

This increase in production means more products (meat, milk) or animals available for sale, boosting revenue.\n\n2. **Cost Reduction**: Farms can reduce costs by optimizing breeding cycles. More efficient reproduction means shorter time between generations, potentially speeding up production cycles and minimizing the time spent waiting for each new batch of animals.\n\n3. **Economic Value of Breeding Stock**: High reproductive success enhances the economic value of rams and ewes. Rams with high libido can breed more ewes, leading to larger litters and higher productivity, which increases their market value and profitability.\n\n4. **Impact of Nutrition and Environment**: Proper nutrition improves conception rates and supports healthy pregnancies, reducing losses from metabolic disorders. Managing environmental factors like temperature ensures consistent breeding success, preventing fertility issues that could reduce profitability.\n\n5. **Breed Selection**: Selecting breeds with higher multiple birth rates can enhance reproductive efficiency, leading to more offspring and increased farm output, which directly contributes to higher profits.\n\nIn conclusion, reproductive efficiency is a key indicator of farm profitability because it drives productivity, reduces costs, and maximizes the economic potential of breeding stock through optimal management practices.", "f1_score": 0.17486338797814208, "cosine_similarity": 0.8299044652810124, "num_chunks": 10, "latency_ms": 9940.769900000305}
