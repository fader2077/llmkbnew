1. **Vitality and Health**: Vitamins A, E, B complex, and C, along with trace minerals like zinc, copper, cobalt, and selenium, are essential for immune function, energy production, and reducing oxidative stress, which helps maintain the sheep's overall health.

2. **Growth and Development**: These nutrients aid in bone development, tissue growth, and the proper functioning of enzymes required for metabolism, ensuring healthy growth and development of lambs.

3. **Reproductive Health**: Adequate levels of these nutrients are crucial for reproductive success, including the health of the sheep and their offspring, preventing issues like miscarriages or stillbirths.

4. **Prevention of Deficiencies**: Deficiencies in these nutrients can lead to severe health problems such as night blindness, white muscle disease, and metabolic disorders, which can reduce productivity and cause economic losses.

In summary, providing trace minerals and vitamins ensures that sheep remain healthy, grow properly, and reproduce successfully, thereby enhancing the overall productivity and well-being of the flock.",15,3668.5462999157608,0.055944055944055944,0,0.6882226998175937,1

1. **Respiratory Transmission**: The primary route is via respiratory droplets when an infected animal coughs, sneezes, or exhales. This method of transmission is common among animals and can also affect humans, making it a zoonotic disease.

2. **Ingestion of Contaminated Materials**: Infected sheep may transmit the disease through the digestive tract by consuming contaminated milk, feces, urine, feed, or water. This route is particularly concerning because it highlights the risk of infection even when animals appear healthy.

3. **Culling Policies**: To prevent the spread of tuberculosis, infected animals are often culled, typically when they show mild signs of illness. This proactive approach helps in controlling the disease by reducing the number of infected individuals in the herd.

4. **Atypical Mycobacteria**: While M. bovis is the primary cause, other mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis and M. avium can also contribute to tuberculosis infections, though they are less common.

In summary, tuberculosis in sheep spreads through respiratory droplets and contaminated materials, with infected animals being culled to mitigate the disease's spread.

Hop-3_TopK-10,3,10,9,How do protein requirements differ between early and mid-lactation?,Higher in early lactation; the influence lessens in mid-lactation.,"During early lactation, goats require a higher intake of dietary protein to replenish the proteins used in milk production, as their own body proteins are depleted. This is because the initial stages of lactation involve using stored proteins, which aren't yet supplemented by feed. As lactation progresses into mid-lactation, the body's protein reserves are sufficient, and goats can rely more on dietary protein for their needs.

**Summary:**
- **Early Lactation:** Requires additional dietary protein to replenish body proteins used in milk production.
- **Mid-Lactation:** Can depend more on dietary protein as body reserves are maintained without depletion.",10,2826.521100010723,0.10810810810810813,0,0.6924728334559695,1

1. **Feed Composition**: 
   - **Crude Protein Content**: Higher levels of crude protein in forage can reduce the need for protein supplements, enhancing efficiency.
   - **Fiber Structure**: The ratio of acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) influences nutrient digestibility. Lower ADF and higher NDF are generally more digestible.

2. **Digestion and Absorption**:
   - Sheep have a digestive system that efficiently processes forages, especially when they are of appropriate maturity, which maximizes protein availability.

3. **Management Practices**:
   - Proper harvesting techniques to maintain forage quality.
   - Adequate storage methods to prevent spoilage and retain nutrient value.

In summary, the efficiency is influenced by the inherent nutritional content of the feed, its digestibility by sheep, and effective management practices that preserve feed quality.",10,3636.507200077176,0.08620689655172413,0,0.7050027296053367,1
