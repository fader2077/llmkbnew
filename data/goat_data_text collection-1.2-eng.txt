All plants and animals worldwide can be classified using seven categories: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. These categories distinguish species within the biological world. Goats are no exception, belonging to the Animal Kingdom, Phylum Chordata, Class Mammalia, Order Artiodactyla, Family Bovidae, Genus Capra, and Species Capra. Therefore, goats can chew the cud and are one of the many ruminants in the world. When ruminants are young, their stomachs resemble those of monogastric animals. However, as they age, their stomachs expand into four or more compartments with distinct but mutually supportive functions. From the mouth to the esophagus, these compartments are named the rumen, reticulate stomach, omasum, and abomasum. This is the most significant difference between the digestive systems of ruminants and monogastric animals like pigs and chickens.

Because goats' teeth and jaw joints are structured differently from those of cattle, their lips can flexibly grip grass. This explains their grazing behavior, which differs from cattle's reliance on tongue-rolling. When grazing, goats first break off the grass stalks with their incisors and then grind them down with their molars. During this process, their mouths secrete saliva, helping the goat grind the fodder or feed and swallowing it more easily. Once the swallowed food reaches the rumen, it is home to nearly a thousand species of microorganisms. These microorganisms break down plant fibers and food debris, forming a bolus that is regurgitated and then chewed and swallowed. The partially digested chyme enters the honeycomb stomach, omasum, and finally the abomasum. Once in the abomasum, the chyme and microorganisms are digested and broken down into nutrients that can be absorbed and utilized by the goat's small intestine.

The abomasum of a newborn lamb accounts for approximately 85% of its total stomach volume. As the lamb feeds its mother's milk, a "sulcus" forms between the end of its esophagus and the reticulum, delivering milk directly into the lamb's abomasum. At this point, the lamb's abomasum, like the abomasum of a monogastric animal, secretes gastric acid to break down the milk into absorbable nutrients, which are then excreted into the lamb's duodenum and other organs for easy absorption. As goats age, their rumen gradually enlarges. Ultimately, the rumen and reticulum of mature goats account for nearly 85% of the total stomach volume, with the omasum accounting for approximately 5% and the abomasum around 10%.

The rumen and recombustion of adult sheep are large, capable of accommodating large amounts of feed and supporting a large population of microorganisms. These microorganisms break down plant fiber into sugars and volatile short-chain fatty acids. The microorganisms also use the sugars they break down as energy, converting protein, amino acids, and even non-protein nitrogen such as urea in the feed into their own protein. The proteins contained in these microorganisms contain most of the important amino acids required by sheep. Once in the abomasum, the microorganisms are digested and broken down into nutrients for the sheep to utilize. Simply put, the rumen and recombustion of sheep act as microbial fermenters, where microorganisms continuously thrive and perform the following functions in the sheep's digestive process: 1. They help convert high-fiber feed, which is difficult for monogastric animals to digest, into usable nutrients. 2. They use the free nitrogen and non-protein nitrogen in the feed to synthesize their own protein , which can meet the majority of the sheep's protein needs. Therefore, even if urea is added to the diet at approximately 1%, microorganisms can convert the nitrogen contained in the urea into high-quality microbial protein. 3. Rumen microorganisms can also synthesize B vitamins and vitamin K. Therefore, supplementing these vitamins in goat feed is unnecessary. However, to fully utilize the functions of the rumen and recombinant stomach, high-quality silage or hay should be provided to young goats to stimulate their development and enable them to fully function as ruminants and digestive systems as they mature.

Energy: Goats require energy to meet their basic maintenance, growth, activity, pregnancy, and lactation needs. Generally speaking, a goat's energy requirements vary depending on its body weight and living environment. Carbohydrates from forage fiber, starch from grains, and feed additives such as fat and molasses are the primary sources of energy in goat diets. When formulating goat feeds, energy can be calculated using total digestible nutrients (TDN), net energy (NE), or metabolizable energy (ME). The simplest way to calculate energy requirements for meat and dairy goats is using total digestible nutrients (TDN). However, since lactation is the most important production trait for lactating goats, net energy (NE) can also be used to calculate energy requirements when formulating lactating goat feeds.

The carbohydrates and fats in forages account for approximately 60-70% of the total energy in a goat's diet. Pennisetum, silage, sedge, semi-dried sedge, Bermuda grass, alfalfa, alfalfa grains, green corn, and corn silage are all excellent sources of carbohydrates in goat fodder. Corn, soybean meal, barley, cassava, bran, rice bran, molasses, oil, and rumen-skimmed fat are also excellent sources of carbohydrates in goat concentrates. Rumen microorganisms in the goat's rumen break down these feed ingredients into short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These short-chain fatty acids are then synthesized into essential nutrients for goats. For example, acetate and butyrate are synthesized into milk fat, while propionate is synthesized into amino acids. Therefore, goats rely on adequate energy to obtain the other nutrients they need. The energy concentration of forage is approximately 40-65% of the dry matter content of forage. Goats that consume more forage have higher concentrations of acetate and butyrate in their rumens, resulting in a higher percentage of milk fat. Most cereals contain approximately 70-90% energy on a dry matter basis. Goats that consume a higher amount of cereals produce a higher proportion of propionic acid in their rumen, leading to faster weight gain. Therefore, formulating a diet for dairy goats should prioritize the proportion of forage, while formulating a finishing diet for mutton goats should prioritize the proportion of concentrates.

Generally speaking, goat diets typically contain 65-80% energy as a percentage of dry matter, adjusted according to the farmer 's specific goals. In Taiwan's hot and humid climate , energy deficiencies often occur in feed formulas, particularly in high-yielding dairy goats. Most goat farmers try to address this energy deficit by purchasing green corn for silage or adding fat and rumen-pass fat to the feed. Long-term consumption of a low-energy diet can lead to slowed growth, weight loss, insignificant estrus, decreased farrowing rates, increased farrowing intervals, a shortened lactation period, and reduced milk production. Goats also experience a significant decrease in resistance to parasites and disease.

Protein: Protein is a complex structure composed of amino acids and is a key component of goat tissue . Goats require a continuous intake of protein to renew their somatic cells and synthesize milk proteins. The amount of protein required by goats varies during growth, fattening, reproduction, and lactation. Therefore , goats with different feeding objectives , weight stages, and lactation levels have varying protein requirements. Rumen microbes in goats typically break down dietary protein and non-protein nitrogen into ammoniacal nitrogen . Rumen microbes use the energy from this ammoniacal nitrogen to synthesize their own proteins . The remaining protein, which cannot be broken down by the microbes , is referred to as undissociated protein or rumen-passing protein. These microbial proteins and undissociated proteins flow to the abomasum , where they are broken down by gastric acid into peptides and amino acids . These peptides and amino acids are then absorbed and utilized by the goat in the small intestine. Since many essential amino acids such as lysine and methionine are the first or second limiting amino acids for the synthesis of milk protein, and the quality and quantity of microbial amino acids obtained by goats every day are very fixed, high-yielding dairy goats often have insufficient quality and quantity of essential amino acids entering the small intestine to meet their milk protein synthesis, which affects their milk quality and milk production. Therefore, when formulating feed for high-lactating goats, feed raw materials with a high percentage of undissociated protein or rumen bypass protein can be used to ensure that their daily diet contains more than 30% undissociated protein or rumen bypass protein.

When formulating goat feed, expressing the protein content of a diet as a percentage of crude protein (CP) is the simplest and most easily understood method. Leguminous forages such as alfalfa and grasses such as pennisetum, sedge, and bermudagrass contain large amounts of digestible protein in their leaves when cut. While the protein content increases with growth, its availability decreases. Therefore, for dairy goats, where forage constitutes a significant portion of their diet, it is crucial to ensure that the forage provided is high in leaves and cut at the appropriate time.

Many plant seeds, animal waste, and agricultural byproducts are also rich in protein. Soybean meal, fish meal, blood meal, and distiller's grains are excellent sources of protein in feed. The recommended protein percentage in goat diets is generally between 14-20%. Early lactation and high lactation dairy goats should aim for 18-20%, mid- lactation dairy goats, growing females, and finishing goats should aim for 16-18%, and pregnant goats and dry goats should aim for 14-16%. While goats can compensate for protein deficiency in their diets by utilizing muscle protein or amino acids in their blood, chronic protein deficiency can lead to slower growth, decreased appetite, weight loss, coarse hair, decreased milk production, irregular estrus, and reduced conception rates. Therefore, goat farmers must pay close attention to protein intake when balancing their diets.

Minerals: Generally speaking , grazing goats are not lacking in minerals. However, as goat farming has shifted from free-range to pen-feeding , insufficient minerals in goat concentrate can lead to metabolic disorders , which can affect production and growth .

Calcium: Calcium is one of the important nutrients for bone formation. If goats lack calcium, their lambs will suffer from rickets or osteomalacia, and adult goats will develop osteoporosis and be prone to fractures. Grass raw materials contain a high percentage of calcium, but because grass has a high cellulose content, it reduces the free calcium, so the utilization rate of grass calcium is not high, while the calcium content in cereals is low. Goats often need a lot of calcium for growth or lactation, so when preparing goat concentrate, it is often necessary to add calcium hydrogen phosphate, shell powder or limestone powder in moderation to meet the needs of goats. Calcium accounts for about 0.3-0.8% per kilogram of diet in goat diets. (2) Phosphorus: Phosphorus is one of the important nutrients for the formation of goat bodies. Phosphorus deficiency can cause goats to lose their appetite and develop pica behaviors such as gnawing on hair, skin and other debris. In fact, when goats lack phosphorus, they will become seriously emaciated, which will affect their reproductive traits. Forage grasses typically contain a low percentage of phosphorus. While cereals contain a higher percentage, this is organic phosphorus and is not easily utilized. Therefore, when formulating feed, it's important to add inorganic phosphorus, such as dicalcium phosphate (also known as dicalcium phosphate), to prevent phosphorus deficiency in goats. Therefore, grazing goats require special attention to phosphorus deficiency, while pen-housed goats must also be mindful of phosphorus excess. Furthermore, when formulating goat diets, the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio must be considered. The optimal ratio is 2:1. An inappropriate calcium-to-phosphorus ratio can lead to urolithiasis in fattening castrated rams, and in severe cases, even death. Phosphorus constitutes approximately 0.3-0.5% per kilogram of diet in meat goat diets and 0.45-0.8% per kilogram of diet in dairy goat diets.

Magnesium: Magnesium is an element that promotes enzyme activation and plays a crucial role in nerve-muscle transmission. It is also involved in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Magnesium deficiency in goats can lead to muscle cramps and, in severe cases, death.

Sulfur : Sulfur is a key component of sulfur-containing amino acids . If sulfur is insufficient, rumen microorganisms will also produce insufficient amounts of essential amino acids such as methionine and cystine. Sulfur is also a building block for many coenzymes , so sulfur deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders in goats.

Potassium, sodium, and chloride: Potassium, sodium, and chloride play important physiological roles in goats. Functions such as osmotic pressure are all related to potassium, sodium, and chloride. Potassium deficiency can lead to endocrine disorders, resulting in weight loss and muscle weakness. Generally speaking, forage grass contains a large amount of potassium, so goats are less likely to suffer from potassium deficiency. Sodium and chloride, on the other hand, are supplied by table salt. A deficiency in these two factors can affect protein metabolism, leading to decreased appetite, slowed growth, and weight loss. Therefore, when preparing goat concentrate, add 0.5% coarse salt to meet the goat's needs.

Trace minerals: Cobalt, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, selenium, and zinc are all trace minerals. Although goats require very small amounts daily, they are essential for their metabolism. Furthermore, a deficiency in a particular trace mineral often affects the absorption and utilization of other trace minerals, minerals, and vitamins. When formulating feed, care should be taken to ensure that excessive trace mineral supplementation can cause toxicity in goats. Therefore, appropriate amounts should be added to the feed.

Vitamins: Vitamins are essential for goats' metabolic processes. Generally speaking, fresh grass contains a high amount of vitamins, so grazing goats are not likely to be deficient. However, for pen-raised goats, when their diet primarily consists of concentrates or sun-dried hays such as sedge hay, alfalfa hay, and alfalfa pellets, the vitamins in these feeds are destroyed during feed processing and hay making. Therefore, vitamins must be added to the concentrate mix to meet the goats' physiological needs.

Vitamin A: Vitamin A deficiency can lead to decreased appetite in goats, reduced semen quality in rams, and a lack of libido. It can also cause estrus in ewes and reduced reproductive efficiency. Severe deficiency can also cause night blindness in goats. Therefore, the 1981 edition of the NRC recommended a minimum of 3,500 international units (IU) of vitamin A per kilogram of goat diet. The 2007 edition of the NRC changed the estimated vitamin A requirement for goats to be based on retinol equivalents (RE).

Vitamin D: Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphorus absorption in goats. A deficiency can lead to an imbalance in calcium and phosphorus absorption, impairing bone development. Grazing sheep synthesize vitamin D from sunlight on their skin and therefore are not susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. However, confined sheep, deprived of prolonged sunlight and limited access to fresh pasture, often suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, the 1981 edition of the NRC recommended a minimum of 250 international units (IU) of vitamin D per kilogram of diet for goats, and the 2007 edition revised the vitamin D requirement for goats.

Vitamin E: Also known as reproductive alcohol, vitamin E deficiency can lead to white muscle disease in lambs and reproductive failure in ewes due to retained placenta. Therefore, the 1981 edition of the NRC recommended a minimum of 5 mg of vitamin E per kilogram of goat diet. The 2007 edition of the NRC revised the vitamin E requirement for goats to be estimated in International Units (IU), with a minimum recommended intake of 5.3 IU/kg body weight and a maximum tolerable intake of 75 IU/kg body weight.

Vitamin B complex and vitamin C: They can be synthesized by rumen microorganisms, so they are not easily deficient.

Water: Water is crucial for goats. It's essential for growth, metabolism, reproduction, and lactation. Generally, water accounts for 75% of a goat's body mass, but this amount varies with age and environment. The majority of water consumed by goats comes from drinking water, feed water, and metabolic water. An adult goat can consume between 4 and 12 liters of water per day. Lactating goats require an additional 2.5 liters of water for every additional liter of milk produced. Factors that influence goat water consumption include feed type, milk production, environment, temperature, and the protein and salt content of the diet. When providing drinking water to goats, it's important to consider water quality; it must be clean and uncontaminated. Farmers relying on groundwater as their primary water source should first aerate the groundwater in aeration tanks before providing it to goats. It's also recommended that the groundwater be tested for contamination by heavy metals, pesticides, and nitrates. Lack of water will cause goats to have lower feed intake, slower growth, and lower milk production. Therefore, goat farmers should not neglect the supply and quality of water because it is easier to obtain water.

Dietary Feeding Standards: Even though the microorganisms in the goat's rumen can synthesize microbial protein, they still need to consume sufficient nutrients daily for effective utilization. The daily supply of nutrients, including energy and protein, must be appropriate. Insufficient nutrition can slow growth and reduce reproductive efficiency, while excessive amounts can be wasteful. In fact, advanced livestock farming countries around the world have conducted countless feeding and nutrition trials over the years, gaining a deep understanding of the energy and protein requirements for goats of varying weights and physiological conditions to achieve established feeding goals. Detailed data on goat nutritional requirements is now available for reference, and this data serves as the "feeding standard."

This article adopts the goat feeding standards set by the U.S. NRC in 1981 and 2007, which are briefly translated as follows: 1. When kept in a pen and with little exercise, the basic nutrients required to maintain body weight are as follows: (1) For a body weight of 10 kg, the required amount is total digestible nutrients (TDN): 159 g, crude protein: 22 g, calcium: 1 g, phosphorus: 0.7 g, vitamin A: 0.4 × 1000 IU, vitamin D: 84 × IU; (2) For a body weight of 20 kg, the required amount is total digestible nutrients (TDN): 267 g, crude protein: 38 g, calcium: 1 g, phosphorus: 0.7 g, vitamin A: 0.7 × 1000 IU, vitamin D: 144 × IU. ×IU; (3) For a body weight of 30 kg, the required amount is: total digestible nutrients (TDN): 362 g, crude protein: 51 g, calcium: 2 g, phosphorus: 1.4 g, vitamin A: 0.9 × 1000 IU, vitamin D: 195 × IU; (4) For a body weight of 40 kg, the required amount is: total digestible nutrients (TDN): 448 g, crude protein: 63 g, calcium: 2 g, phosphorus: 1.4 g, vitamin A: 1.2 × 1000 IU, vitamin D: 243 × IU; (5) For a body weight of 50 kg, the required amount is: total digestible nutrients (TDN): 530 g, crude protein: 75 g, calcium: 3 g, phosphorus: 2.1 g, vitamin A: 1.4 × 1000 IU, vitamin D: 285 ×IU; (6) For a body weight of 60 kg, the required nutrients are total digestible nutrients (TDN): 608 g, crude protein: 86 g, calcium: 3 g, phosphorus: 2.1 g, vitamin A: 1.6 ×1000 IU, and vitamin D: 327 ×IU. 2. In addition to maintaining body weight, the additional nutrients required for different daily gains are as follows: (1) For a weight gain of 0.05 kg, the additional nutrients are: total digestible nutrients (TDN): 100 g, crude protein: 14 g, calcium: 1 g, phosphorus: 0.7 g, vitamin A: 0.3 × 1000 IU, vitamin D: 54 × IU; (2) For a weight gain of 0.10 kg, the additional nutrients are: total digestible nutrients (TDN): 200 g, crude protein: 28 g, calcium: 1 g, phosphorus: 0.7 g, vitamin A: 0.5 × 1000 IU, vitamin D: 108 × IU; (3) For a weight gain of 0.15 kg, the additional nutrients are: total digestible nutrients (TDN): 300 g, crude protein: 42 g, calcium: 2 g, phosphorus: 1.4 g, vitamin A: 0.8 × 1000 IU, vitamin D: 162 × IU. 3. Additional nutrients required by ewes during late pregnancy include: Total digestible nutrients (TDN): 397 g, crude protein: 82 g, calcium: 2 g, phosphorus: 1.4 g, vitamin A: 1.1 x 1000 IU, vitamin D: 213 x IU. 4. Additional nutrients required daily for different growth stages include: Total digestible nutrients (TDN): 347 g, crude protein: 72 g, calcium: 3 g, phosphorus: 2.1 g, vitamin A: 0.8 x 1000 IU, vitamin D: 760 x IU.

The nutritional composition of soybean meal is dry matter: 89%, total digestible nutrients: 81%, crude protein: 44%, calcium: 0.36%, phosphorus: 1.75%, rumen bypass protein 30%.
The nutritional composition of corn is dry matter: 87%, total digestible nutrients: 91%, crude protein: 8%, calcium: 0.02%, phosphorus: 0.35%, rumen bypass protein 30%.
The nutritional composition of pangu hay is dry matter: 85%, total digestible nutrients: 51%, crude protein: 4%, calcium: 0.9%, phosphorus: 0.29%, acid washed fiber: 46%, rumen bypass protein: 30%
The nutritional composition of alfalfa hay is dry matter: 91%, total digestible nutrients: 52%, crude protein: 15%, calcium: 1.13%, phosphorus: 0.18%, acid washed fiber: 44%, rumen bypass protein: 30%.
The nutritional composition of molasses is dry matter: 75%, total digestible nutrients: 72%, crude protein: 58%, calcium: 1.00%, phosphorus: 0.11%
The nutritional composition of silage corn is dry matter: 33%, total digestible nutrients: 70%, crude protein: 8.1%, calcium: 0.23%, phosphorus: 0.22%, acid washed fiber: 28%

Balanced feed formula steps: (1) Review the feeding method of the flock. (2) Estimate the daily dry matter intake of the sheep. (3) Determine the average daily weight gain of meat sheep or the daily milk production and milk fat percentage of lactating sheep. (4) Check the flock weight table to find out the daily nutrient requirements of the flock. (5) Find out the nutrient content of the feed available from the feed nutrient composition table. (6) Calculate the feed composition required for the flock. (7) Calculate the calcium and phosphorus requirements and the calcium-phosphorus ratio. (8) Calculate the acid-washed fiber content of the diet. The acid-washed fiber content of lactating sheep should be greater than 19%. (9) Add 0.5 kg of dicalcium phosphate per 100 kg of feed. (10) Add 0.4 kg of limestone powder per 100 kg of feed. (11) Add 0.5 kg of coarse salt per 100 kg of feed. (12) Add 0.1 kg of vitamin and trace element premix per 100 kg of feed.

Urolithiasis: Urolithiasis in goats often occurs in castrated male goats. Castration narrows the urethra, causing minerals in the urine to form tiny stones, preventing them from being excreted smoothly. These tiny stones can accumulate in injured or narrowed areas of the urethra, eventually forming larger stones. This can cause the goat to urinate only in dribbling bladders. Goats may also kick their abdomens and cry out in pain if touched. If left untreated within 24 hours, the goat may die, and its meat will have a urine-like odor. Urolithiasis in goats is preventable. Management strategies include avoiding castration of male goats before five months of age, as early castration can result in a smaller urethra. However, adjusting feed formula can effectively prevent the symptoms of urolithiasis in castrated goats.

Prevention of urolithiasis includes the following: 1. Ensure the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in feed formulas does not exceed 2:1, and the phosphorus content does not exceed 0.45% to prevent the formation of phosphate stones. 2. Increase the salt content in the feed formula to 0.5% to encourage urinary intake in animals with this condition. 3. Increase the ammonium chloride content in the feed formula to 0.5% to alter the urinary pH of animals with this condition. However, due to the poor palatability of ammonium chloride , other additives may be needed to improve the flavor of the feed. 4. Provide clean water to encourage urinary intake in animals with this condition. 5. Ensure drinking water facilities are convenient for animals to drink freely and are easy to clean.

Pregnancy toxemia or ketosis: Pregnancy toxemia in goats often occurs in female goats in the late stages of pregnancy, while ketosis also often occurs in female goats that have just given birth. This condition often occurs in ewes with a litter size exceeding two or more lambs or in high milk production. The lambs in the uterus squeeze the rumen, causing the ewe's daily energy intake to be insufficient to meet the needs of her body and the fetus. This causes the ewe to metabolize her own fat, resulting in a high concentration of ketone bodies in her blood and acidemia, which often leads to the death of both the ewe and her lambs before giving birth. In highly productive ewes that have just given birth, their milk production needs far exceed their daily food intake, causing them to metabolize their own fat, similarly leading to acidemia with high ketone bodies, which often leads to postpartum death.

Preventing pregnancy toxemia or ketosis can be done by: 1. Avoid overweighting ewes before breeding. Record their pre-breeding body fatness scores for follow-up management and tracking. 2. Increase the proportion of concentrates and reduce the proportion of forage in the feed formula during late pregnancy and early postpartum to improve the energy concentration of the feed. 3. Increase the percentage of high-quality grains in the concentrate to increase the energy concentration of the feed. 4. Use a small amount of rumen-free fat in the feed formula to increase the energy concentration of the feed. 5. Supplement molasses water two weeks before or after calving. 6. Ewes of concern should be isolated and managed individually, and the feed provided should be fresh, small, and frequent. 7. Feed propylene glycol according to veterinary instructions.

Rickets in lambs: Rickets in lambs is caused by vitamin D deficiency or lack of sunlight. A small part of the cause is an imbalance in the calcium-phosphorus ratio in the diet, which causes the lambs' limbs to bend and they are unable to stand.

Rickets in lambs can be prevented by: 1. Keep ewes and lambs in direct sunlight. 2. Ensure vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and a balanced calcium-phosphorus ratio in the lamb's diet. 3. Ensure vitamin D supplementation at birth and a balanced calcium-phosphorus ratio in the lamb's diet. 4. Healthy ewes produce high-quality colostrum.

White muscle disease in lambs: White muscle disease in lambs is caused by a deficiency of vitamin E or the trace element selenium. It often occurs when lambs graze on land lacking the trace element selenium or eat hay of very poor quality, causing the newborn lambs to be unable to stand.

Prevention of white muscle disease in lambs can be as follows: 1. Vitamin E supplementation should be provided to ewes during pregnancy. 2. Vitamin E supplementation should be provided to lambs at birth. 3. Only healthy ewes can produce high-quality colostrum. 4. Ewes with retained placenta should be treated. 5. Lambs can receive vitamin E injections. 6. Vitamin E can be added to the concentrate feed of adult lambs.

Pica in goats: Pica in goats is caused by a lack of the mineral phosphorus. Phosphorus deficiency can cause goats to lose their appetite and even develop pica behaviors such as gnawing on hair, skin, and other debris.

Ways to prevent pica in goats include: 1. Balancing the calcium-phosphorus ratio in the diet. 2. Increasing the proportion of cereals in the diet. 3. Increasing the proportion of calcium hydrogen phosphate in the diet.

Night blindness in goats: Night blindness in goats is caused by vitamin A deficiency. Lack of vitamin A in the diet can cause goats to lose their vision.

Night blindness in goats can be prevented by: 1. Be aware of vitamin A deficiency in goats raised on pasture. 2. For goats that cannot be raised on pasture, provide them with grass. 3. Add vitamin A to their feed. 4. Provide vitamin A supplements during pregnancy. 5. Provide vitamin A supplements for lambs at birth. 6. Healthy ewes produce high-quality colostrum.

Bloat in goats: Bloat in goats is typically caused by consuming large amounts of rich, moist, fresh forage or grains, such as clover, alfalfa, or legumes. These moist, fresh forages form tiny bubbles in the rumen, causing the goat to belch and unable to pass gas. The rumen expands with bubbles, compressing the diaphragm, and the goat may quickly die from respiratory or circulatory failure.

Prevention of bloat in goats includes the following: 1. Those raising goats on pasture should avoid feeding them rich, moist, fresh forage. 2. For non-urgent cases, remove the current feed and avoid feeding the same feed again. 3. Use rumen puncture to relieve rumen pressure. 4. Feed the goats dry.

Enterotoxemia in goats: Enterotoxemia in goats is caused by goats consuming a large amount of concentrate in a very short period of time, which causes the pH value of the goats' rumen to become acidic, allowing clostridia in the intestines to multiply rapidly, resulting in the goats' death from poisoning.

There are several ways to prevent goat hyperacidity: 1. Maintain an appropriate ratio of roughage to concentrate in the goat's diet. 2. Adjusting the amount of roughage to concentrate in the goat's diet takes about 14 days and should be done gradually.

Enterotoxemia: When lambs over-suck goat's milk or eat feed containing a large amount of grain, or when the sheep's daily diet contains rich grains and low hay content, the clostridium in their intestines will multiply and produce toxins, causing the sheep to die rapidly.

Enterotoxemia can be prevented by: 1. Maintaining an appropriate ratio of roughage to concentrate in the goat's diet. 2. Adjusting the amount of roughage to concentrate in the goat's diet takes about 14 days and must be done gradually.

Hypocalcemia: In the late stages of pregnancy or early lactation, due to inappropriate calcium ratio in the diet, the calcium concentration in the blood of the lactating sheep is low, resulting in the ewe's loss of appetite and inability to stand.

Hypocalcemia can be prevented by: 1. Treatment is the same as for ketosis. 2. Calcium supplementation, either orally or through an IV drip. 3. Adjusting the feed formula during late pregnancy or early lactation to increase the ratio of calcium concentrations between these two stages.

Nitrate toxicity: Under normal conditions, nitrate ingested by goats is converted to ammonia in the rumen and then to bacterial protein. However, nitrate converts to nitrite more rapidly than nitrite converts to ammonia. Therefore, when goats consume large amounts of nitrate, the excess nitrite in the rumen diffuses through the rumen wall and enters the goat's bloodstream, converting hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Methemoglobin is unable to transport oxygen, resulting in death from hypoxia.
Ways to prevent nitrate toxicity include: 1. Avoid using young plants. 2. Avoid using plants that have just been fertilized. 3. Avoid using water sources contaminated with nitrates.

Polioencephalomalacia: Polioencephalomalacia (PEM) is a common neuromuscular metabolic disorder caused by a vitamin B1 deficiency. Polioencephalomalacia in goats typically occurs in small ruminants during their growing season who consume a diet high in concentrates. Possible causes include sudden changes in feed, feeding goats a high ratio of molasses, providing goats with moldy hay, providing goats with a high concentrate concentration, weaning stress, and heat stress. This condition occurs when an unbalanced diet or stressful management causes a decrease in rumen pH, preventing the bacteria responsible for vitamin B1 from producing it properly. Excessive sulfur ions in the diet or water can also contribute to the condition.

Prevention of cerebral palsy can be achieved through the following methods: 1. Maintain a balanced diet for goats. 2. Ensure an appropriate amount of sulfur in the diet. 3. Provide high-quality grass or hay as part of the diet. 4. If using grazing water or groundwater for goats, check the sulfur content of the water.

Urea toxicity: Goats can experience excess ammoniacal nitrogen production in their rumen, which then diffuses into their bloodstream, where it is synthesized in their liver and returned to the rumen via saliva. Urea is commonly added to ruminant diets, but excessive amounts can cause death in goats.

Prevention of urea poisoning includes the following: 1. When adding urea to goat feed, use it with ingredients that quickly provide energy. 2. Mix the urea thoroughly into the goat feed. 3. Goats need at least three weeks to acclimate to the urea before they can effectively utilize it. 4. The recommended dosage of urea should not exceed one-third of the total crude protein in the feed.

Ulcerative posthitis: Ulcerative posthitis is a bacterial inflammatory disease that often occurs in breeding rams, rams and wethers. It is caused by the interaction between goats eating high-protein diets or eating large amounts of leguminous forages, which leads to excessive production of urea.

Prevention of ulcerative balanitis includes the following: 1. Provide clean, freely accessible water. 2. Provide a balanced goat diet. 3. Avoid high protein intake. 4. Avoid large amounts of fresh, juicy legumes.

Parasites: Common parasites in goats can be categorized as external and internal. The best preventative measures are to provide a clean environment from birth and minimize exposure to parasites. Balanced nutrition is crucial for maintaining goat health and helping them develop adequate resistance to external pathogens, especially for grazing ewes before and after giving birth.

The following are some ways to prevent parasites: 1. Avoid grazing in wet areas and in the early morning and evening when there is dew on the pasture. 2. Regular deworming.


Forage: Forage is a key component of herbivorous animal diets. To enhance sheep health and performance, forage quality and a stable supply are becoming increasingly important. Whether producing or purchasing, sheep farmers must balance labor costs, economic benefits, and meeting animal needs. Domestically cultivated forages include sedge, pennisetum, Nile grass, and green corn; imported forages include hay products such as alfalfa, Bermuda grass, oats, and Timothy. The following briefly summarizes the types and characteristics of major domestic and imported forages, including their cultivation, management, preparation, and utilization, for reference in forage selection and utilization.

Pangu Grass: Pangu Grass is native to South Africa and is a perennial tropical grass of the Poaceae family . It has runners with roots growing from each node . Its stems are thin and leafy , making it highly competitive against weeds. Currently, the strain cultivated in China is almost exclusively A254, a triploid plant that flowers in summer but does not produce viable seeds . It is propagated vegetatively by stem seedlings. Pangu Grass prefers high temperatures and high rainfall and is adaptable to a wide range of soils . The optimal planting period is March to September . It is propagated by cuttings of 2-3 stem nodes or by broadcasting whole stem seedlings. Cuttings require approximately 300-400 kg / hectare , making them suitable for soils with poor water retention or insufficient moisture. Broadcasting requires approximately 1000-1200 kg / hectare . Whole stems or cuttings should be broadcast when the soil is moist and then pressed down with a disc harrow to ensure the stems are firmly integrated into the soil and allow rooting to develop. Apply 300-400 kg/ha of Compound Fertilizer No. 2 or No. 39 during new planting or at the beginning of each growing season. Apply 300-400 kg/ha of Compound Fertilizer No. 1 after each harvest. Harvest the grass 30-45 days after planting to increase coverage and suppress weeds. Harvest when the grass is 60-80 cm tall. Pangu grass is in its peak production period in spring and summer, with growth stagnating in winter. The annual dry matter yield is approximately 20-30 metric tons per hectare, making it suitable for fodder, hay, and semi-dry silage. The main nutritional components are crude protein (6.1-12.5%), fiber (63.9-75.6%), acid-washed fiber (32.4-43.8%), and medium-washed fiber.

Nile grass: Native to South Africa , Nile grass is a perennial, slender-stemmed grass of the Poaceae family. Bred and selected by the Animal Husbandry Research Institute , three varieties are available : Taichucao 1-3 . Nile grass is not only adaptable to hot and rainy climates , but also thrives well in autumn and winter with irrigation . It flowers year-round but does not produce seeds . Its stems are upright and hollow , with roots forming at the nodes and new shoots growing from the underground rhizomes . Its strong regeneration capacity allows it to be propagated vegetatively by stem seedlings. While Nile grass is best planted during the rainy season , it can be broadcast year-round if irrigation is available . Approximately 2,500 kg of seedlings are used per hectare , using the same method as for pangu grass. For paddy fields, water the soil after preparation and scatter the stem seedlings on the surface . Keep the soil submerged for about five days , then drain after the nodes germinate. Apply 300-400 kg/ha of Compound Fertilizer No. 2 or No. 3-9 during new planting or at the beginning of each growing season . Apply 300-400 kg/ha of Compound Fertilizer No. 1 after each harvest. Harvest the grass 50-60 days after planting (or when the grass is 90-120 cm tall), and harvest every 6-8 weeks thereafter for optimal yield and quality. Nile grass requires more water than pangu grass, so irrigation is necessary if rain does not fall for an extended period during the growing season. Annual dry matter yield per hectare is approximately 25-30 metric tons, making it suitable for fodder, hay, and semi-dry silage. Nile grass varieties are divided into Taixucao No. 1, Taixucao No. 2, and Taixucao No. 3. The main nutritional composition is: (1) The main nutrients of Taixucao No. 1 are crude protein: 8-10%, acid-washed fiber: 38-42%, and medium-washed fiber: 61-67%; (2) The main nutrients of Taixucao No. 2 are crude protein: 9-11%, acid-washed fiber: 33-38%, and medium-washed fiber: 63-68%; (3) The main nutrients of Taixucao No. 3 are crude protein: 8-10%, acid-washed fiber: 33-38%, and medium-washed fiber: 63-68%.

Pennisetum: Pennisetum, also known as elephant grass , is native to South Africa and is a perennial tropical grass of the Poaceae family. Bred and selected by the Animal Husbandry Research Institute , seven varieties are available: Taixucao 1-7 . With the exception of the extremely dwarf variety 6 , suitable for pets , the remaining tall varieties (2 , 4 , and 5 ) and semi-dwarf varieties (1 , 3 , and 7 ) are all upright, high-yielding forage grasses with strong weed competitiveness. Varieties vary in plant shape, leaf-to-stem ratio, and growth characteristics. Tall varieties offer the highest yield , reaching up to 300 tons of fresh grass per hectare annually , while dwarf varieties offer superior quality. Although Pennisetum blooms in autumn , it is cultivated asexually using stem seedlings. Pennisetum prefers high temperatures and high rainfall , and is suited to moist, deep soil . The optimal planting period is from March to September . Cuttings with 2-3 nodes or whole-stem seedlings can be planted flat in a shallow trench and covered with soil. For cuttings, plant rows 50-100 cm apart; for full-stem seedlings, plant rows 80-100 cm apart, and for dwarf varieties, plant rows 50 cm apart. Plant spacing is 50 cm for all varieties. In areas with poor drainage, it is best to create drainage ditches and establish borders for planting. Seedlings should be planted at a rate of approximately 2,000-3,000 kg/hectare. Apply 400-600 kg/hectare of No. 2 compound fertilizer during new planting or at the beginning of each growing season. Apply 400-600 kg/hectare of No. 1 compound fertilizer after each harvest, and 300-400 kg/hectare of No. 2 compound fertilizer after the last harvest of the year. Mow 40-50 days after planting. Irrigate and fertilize after harvest to promote growth and suppress weeds. From the second harvest onward, harvest approximately every 5-8 weeks in summer and 8-12 weeks in winter. Leave stumps approximately 5-15 cm above the ground for optimal yield and quality. In poorly drained areas, avoid mowing during periods of heavy rain and waterlogging. The stumps should be left high to prevent rot at the stem base and roots. Pennisetum yields approximately 20-60 metric tons of dry matter per hectare annually, making it suitable for both fodder and silage. For silage, try mowing during full daylight hours, near noon, for better silage quality. The varieties of Pennisetum are divided into Taixucao No. 1, Taixucao No. 2, Taixucao No. 3, Taixucao No. 4, Taixucao No. 5, Taixucao No. 6 and Taixucao No. 7. The main nutritional composition is as follows: (1) The main nutrients of Taixucao No. 1 are crude protein: 12.8%, acid-washed fiber: 35.0%, and medium-washed fiber: 61.8%; (2) The main nutrients of Taixucao No. 2 are crude protein: 9.2%, acid-washed fiber: 37.9%, and medium-washed fiber: 63.8%; (3) The main nutrients of Taixucao No. 3 are crude protein: 13.1%, acid-washed fiber: 30.9%, and medium-washed fiber: 5 7.3%; (4) The main nutrients of Taixucao No. 4 are crude protein: 11.6%, acid-washed fiber: 38.5%, and medium-washed fiber: 66.0%; (5) The main nutrients of Taixucao No. 5 are crude protein: 9.2%, acid-washed fiber: 46.4%, and medium-washed fiber: 72.9%; (6) The main nutrients of Taixucao No. 6 are crude protein: 12.0%, acid-washed fiber: 31.8%, and medium-washed fiber: 60.7%; (7) The main nutrients of Xucao No. 7 are crude protein: 10.2%, acid-washed fiber: 37.1%, and medium-washed fiber: 67.0%.

Green-cut corn: Green-cut corn is an annual grass family forage plant, harvested whole for animal consumption. Varieties include hard corn for feed, edible corn, or specialized green-cut corn varieties. Common varieties include the imported Mingfeng No. 3, Tainan No. 24 and No. 29, suitable for both hard and green-cut, and Kenting No. 1, developed at the Animal Husbandry Research Institute specifically for green-cut corn. Because green-cut corn has cobs rich in starch and sugar, its nutritional value doesn't drop dramatically with delayed harvesting, making it easy to prepare into silage, earning it the nickname "king of forage." The optimal planting seasons are primarily spring and autumn. Depending on regional climate, spring sowing occurs from early February to early March, while autumn sowing occurs from late August to early October. To minimize supply gaps and effectively utilize land, it is currently cultivated year-round, allowing for rotation with appropriate crops. Plant rows 70-80 cm apart, with plant spacing 20-25 cm. Seed usage varies depending on seed size, approximately 18-20 kg per hectare. Base fertilizer can be 400 kg/ha of No. 39 compound fertilizer. When plants reach 30-40 cm tall, inter-row cultivation should be applied, followed by topdressing with 400 kg/ha of No. 1 compound fertilizer. When plants reach 30-40 cm tall, inter-row cultivation and soil building should be performed along with topdressing to suppress weeds and prevent lodging. Choosing resistant varieties is the most basic pest and disease control method. If pests and diseases occur, refer to control methods for hard corn or edible corn. To avoid pesticide residues, early application of pesticides and biological control should be prioritized. If control measures are not available, early harvesting can be used. Avoiding continuous cropping can also reduce pest and disease occurrence. Green corn yields approximately 10-15 metric tons of dry matter per hectare per crop, making it suitable for green fodder and silage. Yields peak at the yellow ripening stage, and nutritional value is enhanced by increased kernel fill and starch accumulation. However, to accommodate land use, the optimal harvesting period for green fodder can be slightly relaxed , but it should still be avoided too early. For silage, it should still be harvested after the kernels have sunken, when the plant's moisture content is approximately 65-70%. Harvesting too early or too late is not conducive to silage preparation. The main nutritional components are crude protein (6.7-8.2%), acid-washed fiber (28.2-32.6%), and medium-washed fiber (51.2-57.5%).

Alfalfa: Native to southwestern Asia, alfalfa is considered a highly nutritious forage grass in livestock farming, often referred to as "fodder." It is a temperate perennial legume, but can adapt to tropical climates. Flower colors vary, depending on the variety, including purple, yellow, blue, and white. After flowering, it produces pods containing several seeds, which are used for propagation and cultivation. Numerous cultivars of alfalfa exist, and low-lignin, highly digestible varieties have been developed. Alfalfa has a wide temperature adaptability and thrives in well-drained soils. It tolerates drought but is not tolerant of wet conditions. Compared to other forage grasses, alfalfa is high in protein and digestible fiber, rich in minerals and vitamins, and possesses a high feeding value. However, the nutritional value of alfalfa varies significantly depending on the region of production, variety characteristics, and harvest maturity. Several grades of alfalfa are distinguished based on their crude protein and fiber content, with higher crude protein and lower fiber content being considered superior. The main nutritional components are divided into Supreme: crude protein >22%, acid-washed fiber <27%, medium-washed fiber <34%; Premium: crude protein 20-22%, acid-washed fiber 27-29%, medium-washed fiber 34-36%; Good: crude protein 18-20%, acid-washed fiber 29-32%, medium-washed fiber 36-40%; Fair: crude protein 16-18%, acid-washed fiber 32-35%, medium-washed fiber 40-44%; Low: crude protein <16%, acid-washed fiber >35%, medium-washed fiber >44%.

Bermuda grass: Also known as wiregrass or bermudagrass, Bermuda grass is native to Africa and introduced to America for use as lawns or pasture. It is a tropical perennial grass of the grass family. Bermuda grass is highly adaptable, tolerant of both barrenness and drought, and well-adapted to diverse soils. There are numerous varieties of Bermuda grass, including Common, Giant, Coastal, Tifton 44, and Tifton 85. Common and Giant are primarily propagated by seed in the United States. They have small stems and leaves and can be harvested as hay or used as lawns and golf course turf. Coastal and Tifton are interspecific hybrids that cannot produce seeds and instead reproduce asexually by runners or stolons. They have taller plants with long, large leaves, high yields and nutritional value, making them suitable for pasture use. They are better suited to tropical environments than other varieties, but are less cold-tolerant. Bermuda grass is the most common type of imported grass hay. While its acid-washed fiber content is lower than that of pan-grass, its dry matter digestibility is not as good. However, its advantages lie in its finely chopped, dried, and compact packaging. Most imported bermuda grass is a local variety with thin stems and small leaves. Some imported bermuda grass is harvested seed leftover for lawn use. This type of hay has very low nutritional value.
The main nutritional components are hay : crude protein 4.9-7.1%, acid-washed fiber 36.3-43.3%, medium-washed fiber 63.3-69.7%; straw: crude protein 5.7-6.3%, acid-washed fiber 40.2-44.4%, medium-washed fiber 63.1-73.9%.

Oats: Oats are temperate, single-year crops harvested for food and feed, or as a whole plant for forage. The main cultivated varieties for grain are common oats and red oats, both of which can also be used as forage. Black oats are primarily grown as forage or green manure, primarily in Brazil and other South American countries. Common oats thrive in cool, humid environments and are sensitive to heat and drought, while red and black oats are more tolerant of heat and drought. Currently, most oat hay in China is imported from Australia. Australia produces a wide variety of forage oats, categorized by growing season as early-maturing and late-maturing varieties. Early-maturing varieties are suitable for areas with low rainfall, while late-maturing varieties are suited to areas with high rainfall. In suitable seasons, late-maturing varieties produce higher hay yields and quality than early-maturing varieties. Furthermore, Australian forage oats are bred for a high content of water-soluble carbohydrates throughout the plant, resulting in a sweeter hay that is more palatable to animals. Oat hay, particularly the seed-containing ear, is favored by animals for its palatability and nutrient content. The main nutritional components of oat hay are: 3.9-14.6% crude protein, 29.3-40.2% acid-washed fiber, and 49.2-64.5% medium-washed fiber; and 4.6-5.6% crude protein, 33.0-45.7% acid-washed fiber, and 52.9-75.2% medium-washed fiber.

Timothy Grass: Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia , it is now found throughout temperate regions worldwide . It is a perennial temperate grass of the grass family. It thrives in cool, humid climates , but is not suitable for areas with insufficient rainfall and average temperatures above 25°C . It is primarily grown in the northern United States and Canada . It can be grown alone or mixed with other legumes ( alfalfa or clover ) . Timothy Grass is an upright, clumping grass , reaching 60-120 cm in height . Its spikelets are densely clustered into long, cylindrical shapes . It has a shallow, fibrous root system and lacks runners or underground rhizomes . It cannot propagate vegetatively , requiring only seed sowing to establish new pastures. Timothy Grass is primarily used for hay and can be harvested twice a year . It has excellent palatability and nutritional value , making it suitable for both ruminants and pets. In pastures where Timothy Grass is mixed with legumes, most plants use the first harvest for hay and subsequent harvests for grazing. The main nutritional components are crude protein (7.1-14.5%), acid-washed fiber (27.9-47.8%), and medium-washed fiber (53.3-78.6%).

Green mowing: Green mowing is a common method used by domestic sheep farmers , meaning the grass is cut directly and fed to the animals. While this method allows for more control over forage supply , it requires significant labor and time investment , and quality can be affected by the timing of mowing. With the exception of green-cut corn , other domestic forages experience a significant increase in fiber content and a decrease in crude protein and other digestible nutrients as the plant matures with later mowing dates , leading to lower forage quality. Besides mowing date , other factors influencing forage quality also affect green mowing , with temperature having the greatest impact. High temperatures significantly increase the accumulation of fiber content and the degree of lignification in forage . Lower temperatures generally result in better quality . Therefore, given the same mowing cycle , green-cut forage quality is lower in the summer , while quality is better in other seasons. Summer green-cut quality can be improved by shortening the mowing cycle, reducing fertilizer application, and mowing only the upper ends of the forage. In recent years, due to dramatic climate change, prolonged droughts and continuous heavy rains have become increasingly frequent. Lack of irrigation facilities or poor drainage can easily stunt pasture growth or cause the grass to fall over due to rain, leading to the accumulation of nitrates in the grass, especially at the base of the stems. When this occurs, the cutting height should be raised to prevent excessive nitrate poisoning of animals.

Silage: Silage involves selecting appropriate silage materials and storing them in appropriately sized, compactable, and sealable containers. This utilizes the water-soluble carbohydrates in forage as an energy source for lactic acid bacteria, producing large amounts of lactic acid through anaerobic fermentation. This increases the acidity of the forage microenvironment, inhibiting the growth of other bacteria and preserving the nutrients in the forage. Choosing the right silage material requires consideration of the forage's maturity, moisture content, water-soluble carbohydrate content, and acid-base buffering capacity.

In addition to the material properties of forage affecting silage quality, silage container, degree of fineness of cut, silage speed, preparation methods such as compaction and sealing, and post-opening management all influence silage success. Silage Container: To facilitate silage preparation and minimize damage after opening, depending on the number of sheep and their feed intake, barrel-type silage (approximately 80-120 kg), large bales (approximately 500-600 kg), or the recently introduced small round bales (approximately 400 kg) are more suitable for sheep farmers to prepare and use, and are also convenient for handling. Fine Cutting: Fine cutting increases packing density, facilitates air removal, and improves silage success rate. This is especially true for overly dry green corn, which should be finely cut. However, for Pennisetum or other plants with high moisture content, excessive silage cutting should be avoided, as it releases too much water. Silage Speed: After harvest, the grass plant and surface microorganisms continue to respire, resulting in nutrient consumption and heat generation. Pennisetum is particularly prone to heat production and a decrease in water-soluble carbohydrate content after being piled, so silage must be completed as quickly as possible. Compaction: Regardless of the type of silage being prepared, it is essential to utilize various methods to compact the material, such as using hydraulic equipment or heavy objects for barrel and bag silage. Compacting expel air from the silage container as quickly as possible to achieve a low-oxygen state, promoting lactic acid fermentation. Tight compaction also reduces air infiltration after opening, minimizing spoilage. Sealing: Keeping the container sealed preserves the nutritional value of the silage. When preparing barrel silage, use film to seal the opening or invert it to prevent air from entering. Bag silage requires a secure seal to ensure optimal silage quality. If barrel silage is properly sealed and used immediately after opening, the compaction density can be reduced during filling. This maintains good silage quality while also minimizing the inconvenience caused by compaction. Management after opening: When the silage is opened, if the compaction is insufficient , the silage will become corrupt due to air infiltration. Therefore, the appropriate size of silage container should be selected according to the scale of breeding. If it cannot be used up in one go, it should be sealed immediately after use and used up as soon as possible.

To ensure a stable supply of high-quality forage for ruminants, hay and silage are the primary methods for preserving forage nutrients. Domestically grown pangu grass and Nile grass are primarily used for hay production, while green corn is primarily used for silage. However, the summer months, when pangu grass and Nile grass are most suitable for growth, are often subject to weather conditions. After harvest, they are exposed to rain while drying in the fields, making it difficult to produce high-quality hay and even resulting in the loss of the entire batch. Depending on weather conditions, semi-dry silage can be produced. While silage is typically produced with a moisture content of 60-70%, semi-dry silage is produced with a moisture content of 40-60%. Moisture content must be carefully considered during production; excessive moisture content results in significant dry matter loss. However, excessive withering before ensilage, which reduces the moisture content, inhibits fermentation and compromises silage quality. Because pangu grass is difficult to finely chop and fill, film bales are the ideal method for production. Currently, there are machines capable of producing film-wrapped round bales weighing approximately 150 kg each, suitable for sheep farms. Semi-dry silage not only reduces hay curing losses caused by weather conditions, but also overcomes the problem of Pangu hay's insufficient water-soluble carbohydrate content for good silage. Semi-dry silage can be fully fermented after just one month of storage. Experimental testing has shown that well-cured Pangu hay semi-dry silage significantly outperforms Bermuda hay in terms of palatability and feed intake.

Hay: Hay is convenient to use and can be stored for a long time, making it a common forage feed for herbivorous animals. However, hay production requires specialized machinery and large-scale operations, making it difficult for sheep farmers to prepare on their own. Therefore, they choose to feed their animals imported or domestically produced hay. To meet the nutritional needs of animals, hay quality is a key consideration when purchasing. This can be assessed by the type of hay, its appearance, and analytical reports provided by the vendor or submitted by the farmer. While many grasses are used as hay, grasses and legumes are the primary forages. These grasses can be categorized as tropical or temperate based on their adaptability to their growing environments. Generally speaking, legumes have higher protein content than grasses, while temperate grasses have lower fiber content than tropical grasses. Therefore, alfalfa, a temperate legume, generally makes for a better-quality hay.

Hay Type: Visual evaluation can also provide a rough estimate of hay quality, such as leaf ratio, color, presence of spikes, and inclusions. A higher leaf ratio and greener color generally indicate better quality, but color varies between different hay types, and excessive exposure to the sun can also affect hay color, making color inappropriate as the sole evaluation criterion. Generally, the fiber content of grasses increases after flowering, so hay with a high spike content is of lower quality. Inclusions such as weeds and dead branches can affect animal palatability, and a higher percentage of inclusions indicates lower quality. Odor is also an important evaluation criterion; a musty or rotten odor indicates poor hay quality.

To accurately formulate a diet, hay type identification and appearance evaluation are insufficient to accurately represent hay quality. Compositional analysis is required for quantitative description and quality grading. Key analytical items include dry matter (DM): the percentage of the total weight of the forage after deducting water, which serves as the basis for diet formulation and animal feed intake calculation; crude protein (CP): This consists of both true protein and non-protein nitrogen. Forage with a high protein content is more likely to meet animal needs and reduce the purchase of protein supplements; acid detergent fiber (ADF): The part of the forage that is difficult for animals to digest. A higher acid detergent fiber content means lower digestibility and lower forage quality; neutral detergent fiber (NDF): The part of the cell wall structure of the forage, mostly slow-digesting substances. The NDF content is generally inversely proportional to the animal's feed intake; a higher NDF content means lower feed intake; and relative feed value (Relative Feed Value). RFV) is an index composed of digestible dry matter rate and dry matter intake, which can be used as a basis for evaluating forage quality and feeding effect. The higher the value, the better the forage quality.

Pangu Grass: Used for green fodder, hay, and semi-dry silage, it has an annual dry matter yield of 20-30 metric tons per hectare. Pangu Grass is characterized by its creeping stems, each node of which can root and grow, and has many thin stems and leaves. The planting area required for every 100 goats is 1.1-1.7 hectares.

Alfalfa: This product is hay, high in protein and digestible fiber, and also rich in minerals and vitamins.
Bermuda grass: There are two types of items. One is hay, which is a tropical forage grass. Although its nutritional value is slightly lower, it is finely chopped, dry and tightly packed. The other is grass straw, which has a high fiber content, low nutritional value and digestibility, and is more suitable as a feed for non-lactating sheep.
Oats: There are two types of items. One is hay, the whole plant has a high content of water-soluble carbohydrates, good palatability and rich in nutrients. The other is grass stalks, which have a high fiber content and lower nutritional value than oat hay, and are more suitable as feed for non-lactating sheep.
Timothy Grass: This product is hay with good palatability and nutritional value. In addition to being used for ruminants, it can also be used as forage for pets.

Soybean hulls: Soybean hulls are the outermost seed membrane layer of soybeans. After drying, the soybean hulls are fluffy, very light , transparent and light yellow, and have a fragrant taste. They contain more than 8% protein, 46% acid-washed fiber, 64% medium-washed fiber, and more than 30% crude fiber. They are high-quality fiber and protein supplement feed for ruminants.

Sake meal: Sake meal is a water-rich byproduct of the alcohol production process. In Taiwan, brewer's meal and sorghum sake are commonly used for ruminants. Because the starch is largely broken down during the alcohol production process, the remaining nutrients in these byproducts, such as protein, minerals, and trace elements, increase three to fourfold on a dry matter basis. Therefore, they are commonly used as a protein supplement for ruminants in Taiwan. However, their high water content makes them difficult to transport and store.

Bran: Bran is the outer husk of wheat. It is fluffy and has a pleasant texture, stimulating ruminants to increase feed intake. Rich in protein and phosphorus, it is often used by feed formulators to supplement ruminant diets with protein and phosphorus. However, due to its high phosphorus content, its use in fattening castrated wethers should be minimized.

Other domestically produced agricultural and food by-products: Taiwan's subtropical climate, characterized by high temperatures and high humidity, is ideal for growing a wide variety of agricultural products. Consequently, a significant number of agricultural and food by-products are produced. However, when using agricultural and food by-products, care must be taken regarding their high water content, pesticide content, transportation and storage, and nutritional balance.

Corn distillers' grains: Corn distillers' grains are a byproduct of producing corn ethanol from corn starch, replacing petroleum. They are high in protein, crude fiber, minerals, and trace elements, and are affordable and offer a stable yield. They are popular not only with large ruminant breeders but also with feed mills to adjust protein levels in feed formulations and reduce feed costs.

Soybean meal: Soybean meal is the residual byproduct left after soybeans are degreased and oiled . It is very high in protein , though its protein content varies significantly depending on the degreasing method . It is the primary source of protein in ruminant concentrates.

Corn: Corn is the world's most produced crop. Most of the corn used in Taiwan's livestock industry comes from North and South America. Generally speaking , corn kernels graded 2 and below are primarily used as feed. They contain approximately 8% protein and 91% total digestible nutrients, making them an excellent source of energy for ruminants.

Cereal concentrate formulation: To maximize ruminant production efficiency, livestock producers supplement ruminants with cereal concentrates to meet their nutritional needs at various stages of development, production, and reproduction. Cereal concentrate supplementation aims to provide ruminants with four key nutrients: crude protein, energy, minerals, and vitamins.

Preservation of wet by-products: Wet by-products contain a lot of water, which makes them easy to go rancid and difficult to preserve. It is necessary to add an appropriate amount of drier by-products to reduce their moisture content by at least 50%. They should then be sealed and preserved in silage pits, sausage-type silage bags or plastic barrels. This can prevent the wet by-products from going rancid and achieve the goal of long-term and stable supply of ruminant diets.

Traditional Hand-Feeding: Meat-producing ruminants raised using the traditional method require daily forage to be divided into four parts, with a ratio of approximately 1:4:1:4. Concentrate can be divided into two parts, with a ratio of approximately 1:1. In the morning and evening, 1/10 grass is fed first, followed by 1 part concentrate and 4/10 grass. Dairy ruminants raised using the traditional method require daily forage to be divided into four parts, with a ratio of approximately 1:3:3:3. Concentrate can be divided into three parts, with a ratio of approximately 1:1:1. At dawn, 1/10 grass is fed first, followed by 1 part concentrate and 3/10 grass. In the evening, 1 part concentrate and 3/10 grass are fed. At night, 1 part concentrate and 3/10 grass are fed again.

TMR mixer: TMR mixer can completely mix the daily feed ingredients for goats to prevent goats from being picky eaters. TMR mixers are available in fixed and mobile types, with different prices depending on the space planning and breeding scale of the goat breeder's sheep house.

Feeding Order and Precautions: To maximize the uniformity of the TMR mixer's mixing , the order in which feed ingredients are added must be carefully considered. The principle of feeding order is as follows: 1. Longer or larger-particle forages, such as hay, should be placed in the TMR mixer first. 2. Cereals, concentrates, or dry premixes should be added in the following order. Mineral or vitamin premixes should be dispersed with cornmeal before addition. 3. Wet by-products, corn silage, semi-dried silage, molasses, and other liquids should be added. 4. Mixing time should not exceed 15 minutes , and after the last feed ingredient is added, mixing should not exceed 5 minutes. 5. Do not overfill the TMR mixer, leaving room for mixing. 6. The moisture content of feed mixed in a TMR mixer will vary depending on the moisture content of the ingredients , with the final moisture content being approximately 30-40 %.

Uniformity Analysis: When using TMR feed blends , due to the varying physical properties, moisture content, and particle size of feed ingredients, some of the mixed feed may separate from the coarse and fine materials after mixing. This can lead to picky eating in animals , negatively impacting the original purpose of TMR use and reducing the economic benefits of using TMR . The Penn State Particle Separator (PSPS) is widely used for particle size analysis and can be used to measure the effective fiber quality of TMR on-site .

Preventing Picky Eating: To prevent ruminants from being picky eaters, please note the following: 1. TMR feed should contain an appropriate amount of moisture. Hold the feed gently so that no water drips, and the feed clumps do not fall apart when you open your palm. 2. Screen with a University of Pennsylvania particle size separator to ensure uniformity. 3. Pre-cut long grasses or other agricultural byproducts. Hay, green corn, silage, etc. should not exceed 2 cm in length when placed in the TMR mixer. 4. The mixed TMR feed should be fragrant and light yellow in color. 5. Prepare the prepared TMR feed just before each feeding, and ensure that the entire feed is fully prepared to avoid fermentation and heat generation from leftover feed, which can affect the ruminant's appetite. 6. When feeding ruminants with TMR, ensure that the animal can finish the feed each time. 7. Clean any remaining feed from the feed trough before the next feeding. 8. Feed small, frequent meals whenever possible.

Feeding time, amount, and frequency: Ruminants are typically fed TMR twice daily, typically in the morning and afternoon. However, for high-yielding ruminants, TMR may be provided up to three or four times daily, in the morning, afternoon, and evening. The amount provided should be sufficient for the ruminant to consume within 10-15 minutes.


Newborn lamb rearing: The period from birth to weaning is a critical one. The growth rate during this period directly impacts the ewe's future breeding age, the number of lambs born per litter, the number of litters during her lifetime, and milk production. Other factors include the wether's fattening progress and the ram's breeding size. Numerous factors influence lamb weight gain, broadly categorized as ewe, feed, environment, and disease. Indeed, careful management is crucial from the late stages of pregnancy. If a ewe experiences a difficult birth before lambing, her physiological response to stress triggers the release of adrenaline. This hormone, however, is transferred across the placenta to the fetus, leading to a weakened immune system and subsequent growth retardation. After leaving the mother's womb, the cleanliness and warmth of the newborn's birth environment, the intake of high-quality, sterilized colostrum, the amount of milk consumed by the lamb, the quality of milk replacer and starter feed , and diseases such as diarrhea and respiratory problems are all often overlooked factors that can impact the lamb's weight gain rate and stability before and after weaning. The care of lambs from birth to weaning involves many small details that have a big impact . Mastering the feeding management to improve the growth and development of lambs will surely achieve the basic business goals of replacing culled ewes, maintaining the economic scale of the flock, and selling lambs or goat milk , thus laying the foundation for the sheep farm's profits.

Post-natal examination of lambs: Newborn lambs should be assisted in clearing the mucous membrane fluid from their mouths and noses immediately to enable them to breathe smoothly on their own and reduce respiratory problems caused by inhalation of foreign objects. In addition, help to tidy up the lambs' hair and keep their bodies dry and clean to prevent the lambs from hypothermia and cold. The broken umbilical cord will be the main wound infected with pathogens and inflamed. Prepare cotton thread and scissors soaked in iodine solution for disinfection. Then use cotton thread to tie the umbilical cord about 1-2 cm away from the abdomen and tie a knot. Cut off the excess cotton thread and umbilical cord below the knot. Then spray iodine solution to disinfect the umbilical cord area at the abdomen after each meal until the umbilical cord is dry.

Lamb Barn Environment: After birth , lambs face a dramatic shift in their environment , from the constant, sterile temperature of their mother's body to one characterized by fluctuating temperatures and the omnipresence of bacteria. Lambs are fragile , and their organs are easily affected by cold, weakening their immune system and leading to respiratory and digestive tract diseases. Domestic sheep pens are built with raised beds , making it crucial to provide lambs with draft-proof space ( Figure 2) and heating facilities ( Figure 3). This allows lambs to choose warmth based on their body's needs , minimizing the risk of cold. Hygiene in lamb housing requires adequate ventilation and a dry, clean pens.

Colostrum Intake and Absorption: Lambs should receive their first colostrum feeding within 15-30 minutes of birth, preferably within an hour. The first colostrum expressed after farrowing should be used. Adequate colostrum feeding (10% of body weight, divided equally into 3-4 feedings) should be provided within the first 6 hours of life. This colostrum-only feeding regimen should continue for 2-3 days. Bottle feeding ensures that each lamb receives an adequate amount. If the lamb is nursing from the ewe, it may not receive enough, especially in multiple births. Lambs that are weak and unable to suckle on their own should be fed through a nasogastric tube and syringe. Colostrum contains essential antibodies and immunoglobulins, and colostrum intake protects the lamb against disease. The amount of colostrum consumed and the concentration of antibodies in the colostrum determine the lamb's total antibody intake. Insufficient total colostrum intake will prevent the protective effect from lasting until one month of age. Following farrowing, the antibody content in colostrum decreases rapidly, and the lamb's intestinal ability to absorb antibodies diminishes 10-12 hours after birth. Therefore, delaying the collection of ewe colostrum or feeding colostrum to lambs after birth will prevent the intestine from absorbing sufficient antibodies. Hot barn conditions, dams experiencing difficult births, overcrowding, fighting between lambs, and rough handling and feeding of lambs can cause stress in lambs and reduce antibody absorption. Bacterial contamination of colostrum and its adsorption to intestinal mucosal surfaces can also reduce antibody absorption. If lamb probiotics are to be supplemented , they should be started six hours after the last colostrum feeding.

There are two methods for nursing lambs: natural nursing and artificial nursing. Natural nursing lambs nurse from birth until weaned, requiring less effort than artificial nursing. However, it can cause udder deformation and nipple damage, making weaning more difficult. Furthermore, it can delay the return of estrus and conception after birth. This method is primarily used in meat goats. Controlling colostrum quality primarily relies on observing the ewe's udder for abnormalities and ensuring cleanliness. However, if caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) is not eliminated from the flock, vertical infection from goat suckling can occur.

Artificial lactation is commonly used for dairy goats. After birth, the lambs are separated from their dams and fed colostrum by hand for 3-5 days, then switched to a milk substitute until weaning. This method requires considerable care and effort, with strict adherence to feeding schedules, feeding amounts, milk quality, and clean utensils. Colostrum handling is also strictly controlled. The use of artificial lactation on domestic mutton goat farms is on the rise.

Ewe milk can contain pathogens, which can cause lambs to become infected and suffer health consequences. Prevention of caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) through milk transmission is particularly important in China. Immediately separating lambs from their dams after birth and sterilizing their milk can offer some protection. Another alternative to preventing CAE from colostrum in lambs is the use of artificial colostrum powder, which typically contains high concentrations of immunoglobulins and added nutrients. It is pathogen-free and therefore does not require heat sterilization. Furthermore, it can be prepared quickly and easily, facilitating hygiene control. While its use is limited to one day, it can increase lamb feeding costs.

Natural feeding: Most mutton farms house lambs and ewes for natural feeding , eliminating the need for manual milk measurement, temperature control, and feeding timing , saving both time and effort. After birth , some lambs may need to be coaxed into nuzzling and suckling. Naturally fed lambs nurse at will, feeding multiple times and mimicking the ewes' learning to eat dry feed more quickly , allowing them to reach their maximum weight . However, there is considerable variability in growth progress between lambs of the same litter. Naturally fed lambs are dependent on their dams , making it difficult to switch to bottle feeding if their milk supply becomes compromised . They also tend to be more feral and less amenable to human control. Most natural feeding operations utilize group pens , where ewes and lambs are housed in groups , leading to frequent pushing and fighting , and difficulty detecting problematic lambs. Providing lambs with free access to shelters or warm, protective wooden boxes can provide protection from aggression by larger lambs and help protect them from drafts in raised beds.

There is an increasing trend in the use of single-ewe penning for lactating sheep on mutton farms. Ewes and their lambs are kept in separate pens, eliminating the tendency for group-housed ewes to reject non-family lambs. Abnormal lambs can also be quickly identified, improving sheep care efficiency. Pens can be equipped with gates, allowing lambs to enter and exit the pen freely while keeping ewes away from creep feeding areas.

For naturally nursing lambs to be weaned as early as eight weeks of age, a plan can be implemented at two weeks of age to separate them from their ewes in the mornings and keep them together at other times, but in adjacent pens, maintaining visual contact. After a week, separate them during the day, and at six weeks of age, keep them together only in the mornings, until they are fully separated at eight weeks of age, at which point the ewes are removed from their pens while the lambs remain in their original pens. Regardless of the planned weaning time, this concept of gradually increasing the time spent away from their ewes and reducing the number of times they are together can be applied to shorten the nursing period, achieve early weaning, and promote the return of reproduction after parturition. This allows ewes to give birth three times within two years, while simultaneously ensuring the lambs' transition from weaning to weaning is successful.

three days of colostrum feeding , lambs can switch to regular goat milk or a milk substitute. During the first week after birth , breastfeeding should be frequent , but the amount of milk each time should be small . Starting in the second week, the frequency of feedings decreases , but the amount of milk each time increases. At six to seven weeks , the amount of milk and the frequency of feedings begin to decrease until weaning to facilitate the transition. If the lamb develops loose stools or diarrhea , the amount of milk fed each time should be immediately reduced , and the frequency of feedings increased. Artificial feeding requires careful attention to the temperature of the milk, the frequency of feedings, the amount of milk fed, and the intervals between feedings . The milk should generally be warmed to 37-38 °C . Overheating can easily cause burns to the lamb 's mouth and throat , while overcooling can often cause diarrhea . In these cases , the amount of milk fed each time can be split over several feedings.

Starter Feeding Plan: To quickly establish a complete rumen ecosystem similar to that of adult ruminants, lambs must be taught to consume solid feeds early to promote rapid rumen growth and development. Providing concentrate feed promotes the development of the rumen wall and papillae, while providing fodder promotes rumen volume expansion and increases absorptive surface area. However, under moderate to high-sugar feeding regimes, lambs may become satiated by excessive milk intake, leading to delayed starter feed intake and weaning discomfort. This is primarily due to the fact that starter feed contains only approximately 40-60% of the metabolizable energy of breast milk. To maintain the weight gain benefits of moderate to high-sugar feeding during the early stages of life, lambs must be fed a sufficient starter feed early to bridge the gap in nutrient intake from weaning to concentrate feed, at least to avoid weight loss during the weaning period.

During the nursing period, an ideal creep feed feeding strategy is essential. Dry matter intake and water intake are proportional, so water intake can promote creep feed intake. Lambs can be encouraged to drink water starting three days after birth. Since lambs cannot yet use a drinker, clean water should be provided in a bucket. The bucket should be cleaned and changed at least once a day. At one week of age, lambs can be encouraged to consume creep feed. The amount of feed should be increased as the lambs age. The goal is to have lambs consume at least 180 grams of creep feed daily by the time they start weaning and at least 200 grams daily by the time they are weaned.

Forage and hay are only supplied to lambs when they are 7 weeks old. Since the digestible nutrients contained in forage are much lower than those in concentrate, and lambs have poor fiber digestion ability at this age, and the bulk of forage easily takes up a lot of rumen space, thus reducing concentrate intake, it is generally recommended that forage be supplied in the middle and late stages of the lactation period compared to concentrate, and high-quality grass hay or alfalfa hay is preferred, and the feeding amount should be adjusted and increased weekly.

Weaning and Weaning Plan: Weaning is a new phase for lambs, and some lambs may have difficulty adapting, resulting in weight loss. The timing of weaning depends on the lamb's developmental status and solid feed intake. Generally, it is recommended that goats be housed at least two to three months of age.

Post-weaning lamb planning: After weaning, lambs transition from an incomplete solid diet to a complete solid diet consisting of only concentrates and fodder. Poor adaptation to the transition can delay the entire growth process. To minimize the stress of the transition and the resulting instability in feed intake and weight gain, lambs should remain in their original pen for at least two weeks after weaning, with minimal drastic changes to their diet. Once their feed intake and weight gain stabilize, adjust feed amounts and subsequent feeding plans based on individual lamb feeding goals.

Ewe Weight Gain and Breeding: The ideal breeding goal for ewes is to be able to give birth and produce milk by 12 months of age. Based on a five-month gestation period, breeding is essential at 7 months of age. For breeding, the recommended weight for ewes is 60% of their adult body weight (approximately 30 to 35 kg). Therefore, if a ewe weighs 3 kg at birth and is bred at 7 months of age, this ewe must grow at least 1 kg per week, an average daily gain of approximately 143 grams. This is a moderate growth rate and requires adequate nutritional support to maintain this steady growth. Once the ewe reaches breeding weight, a gradual increase in concentrate feed can be initiated 6-8 weeks prior to breeding. A daily intake of 0.5 kg of concentrate per female should be provided one week prior to breeding to stimulate estrus and ovulation. During this period , constant attention must be paid to the ewe's growth and development to avoid infertility caused by obesity.

Post-weaning lambs are in a period of rapid physiological growth and should be fed a high-nutrient diet to promote rapid weight gain. In addition to providing ample, high-quality forage, ewes should also be given a small amount of concentrate feed, but the daily amount should not exceed 0.2 kg to prevent obesity and reproductive problems. Providing high-quality fodder can reduce reliance on concentrate feed.

Weight Gain and Fattening of Rams: The ideal breeding goal for meat goats is to be marketable by 12 months of age, meaning a weight of over 50 kg. For a ram weighing 3 kg at birth, for example, 1 kg of growth is required per week to achieve this goal. To reach marketable weight earlier, weaned castrated rams can be fed a lower feed to concentrate their grain ratio, opting for a high-energy, high-protein diet. However, careful nutrient balance is crucial. Maintaining a consistent ratio of calcium and phosphorus can lead to urinary stones and urethral obstruction. Castrated rams are more susceptible to this condition, so a calcium-to-phosphorus ratio of 1.5-2:1 is generally recommended. Additionally, an adequate supply of clean drinking water helps prevent urine concentration, which can lead to stones. Fattening goats must reduce their exercise intake to avoid wasting energy and affecting fattening results.

Late Pregnancy Management: During the last 50 days of pregnancy, 70% of fetal development is complete, and most mammary gland development also occurs during this time. Colostrum synthesis then begins, leading to a dramatic increase in the ewe's nutrient needs. Late pregnancy feeding and management impacts lamb survival, birth weight, postnatal survival, and postnatal weight gain. The quality of the ewe's colostrum and reproductive efficiency after parturition are also impacted. The rapid fetal growth during late pregnancy occupies a significant amount of abdominal space, particularly in multiple pregnancies. This significantly reduces the space available for gastrointestinal storage of feed. Insufficient energy intake and a negative energy balance can lead to metabolic disorders such as preeclampsia. Pregnant ewes should be fed a high-digestible energy diet containing at least 12% crude protein and high-quality forage to maximize forage intake. Reduce the use of juicy, unstable, and unpalatable cut grasses and silage. Instead, use alfalfa mixed with Bermuda hay. However, be aware that legumes are high in calcium, so they should be reduced or avoided before farrowing and replaced with other forages to prevent hypocalcemia (milk fever). Grass hays with high potassium content should also be fed in reduced amounts to avoid the same problem. Pregnant ewes fed low-quality or hay-based forages should supplement their feed with vitamin A to prevent fetal growth impairment. This can also improve colostrum quality and postnatal immunity. Gradually increase concentrate feed intake in late pregnancy to promote rumen microbial adaptation and stimulate the redevelopment of rumen papillae. However, ewes should still be grouped according to their leanness and adjust concentrate feed intake to increase or maintain leanness . The recommended leanness before farrowing is 2.75-3.5. Ewes should have an appropriate amount of body fat stored at farrowing to achieve high milk production in early lactation. Concentrate feeding should be gradually increased, reaching at least 1% of body weight before farrowing. Forage intake should not be neglected; high forage intake in late pregnancy will encourage high forage intake during lactation. Ensure that there is an ample supply of fresh water; pregnant ewes may drink up to 15 liters daily. During the final weeks of pregnancy, the udder develops rapidly and, in high-producing ewes, may appear very swollen and asymmetrical. It's often tempting to express some milk at this time to reduce udder pressure, but unless the ewe is clearly uncomfortable, this is best avoided as it can affect colostrum production during farrowing.

Drying Period Management: The dry period is a critical transition period for lactating sheep. However, because milking is stopped, observation opportunities are reduced, making it easy to overlook problematic sheep. Drying can be performed naturally or artificially. Natural drying occurs primarily due to reduced nutrient intake and low milk production, resulting in a rapid decline in milk production after pregnancy. Artificial drying involves gradually reducing milk production through changes in the sheep's lifestyle, such as reducing milking frequency, reducing concentrate feed and water intake, changing the diet, and increasing exercise. During the dry period and the immediate post-dry period, the udder should be inspected frequently to check for abnormalities in milk color and taste, and close attention should be paid to the presence of mastitis. A dry period of at least six to eight weeks before farrowing provides ample time for the lactating sheep to rest and recover, while also allowing for mastitis treatment. Conversely, the latter part of the dry period, two to three weeks before farrowing, is designed to facilitate the physiological transition from dryness to milk production. The stocking density of dry sheep should be reduced, or individual farrowing pens should be provided (Figure 13). Ewes should be grouped or kept together to avoid crowding. First-time lambs and multiparous lambs should be kept in separate pens.

Goat Pregnancy Period and Precautions: The gestation period for goats ranges from 143 to 157 days, with an average of 150 days. Therefore, the expected date of birth can be estimated from the time of breeding. Pregnancy can be confirmed by observing estrus behavior at least one month after breeding, or by performing an abdominal ultrasound scan. Pregnant ewes should have their hooves trimmed and receive deworming treatment at least two months before birth. The delivery area should be clean, dry, and draft-proof to prevent newborn lambs from catching cold, which reduces their survival rate. The ewe's abdomen and vulva should be kept clean and tidy, and all necessary delivery equipment should be available. During the week before birth, monitor the ewe's physical condition, behavior, and appearance for changes. Avoid excessive concentrates during this period. Consider providing a mild laxative, such as bran, to help with bowel movement and facilitate a smooth birth. Additionally, feeding straw to dilate the stomach and intestines can help stimulate appetite after birth.

Postpartum Care for Goats: After giving birth, pay attention to the temperature in the delivery room to avoid heat stress and prevent drafts from entering to prevent cold. After delivery, use warm water to clean the ewe's buttocks, vulva, tail, and hind legs to remove fetal fluid, mucus, and dirt to prevent infection . The delivery room should be kept clean and dry. After delivery, pay attention to the passage of the afterbirth. If it persists for more than 12 hours , it may be related to weak uterine contractions , which can easily lead to uterine inflammation . Oxytocin can be injected to facilitate expulsion , but it is still recommended to consult a veterinarian as soon as possible. About one hour after delivery , the ewe can be fed molasses water . Take 2 liters of warm water , add 200 grams of molasses, and mix . This will replenish lost water and iron , and provide quick energy to promote milk production. Ewes should be provided with high-quality hay after delivery. Supplement with juicy green grass to stimulate the appetite. Gradually increase the amount of concentrate feed until one week after delivery, at which time they can resume their normal diet.

Early Lactation Management: High feed conversion efficiency during the period from farrowing to peak milk production is crucial for dairy farms. Although ewes' feed intake gradually increases after farrowing, it lags behind the increase in milk production, resulting in a negative energy balance. Ewes must compensate for their insufficient feed intake by breaking down body tissues (fat and protein) to produce nutrients. The diet must contain a high level of digestible nutrients to prevent excessive breakdown of body tissues (fat), which can lead to metabolic disturbances such as ketosis. To increase productivity and ensure high feed efficiency, a challenge feeding strategy can be employed. This involves continuously increasing the concentrate feed intake based on fatness, milk production, or litter size (for mutton sheep), while ensuring ample access to fresh, clean water. In addition to adding 0.5 kg of concentrate for every kg of milk production increase, an additional 250 to 500 grams of concentrate can be fed to challenge or induce milk production. If milk production does not increase further, it indicates the ewe has reached its genetic limit. After farrowing, increase the amount of concentrate feed to avoid digestive discomfort such as clumping and loose stools. The concentrate to roughage ratio in the diet should not exceed the upper limit of 60:40 to prevent acidosis, bloating, and other problems. Feeding ewes high-quality forage helps stimulate milk production. Each dairy goat should have at least 1.75 square meters of space; if the flock is composed of unfamiliar, unrelated goats, double the space is required. Overcrowding during this period can cause extreme stress, resulting in reduced production. Furthermore, the troughs and waterers used in the late-gestation pen should be the same as those used in the early-lactation pen to prevent poor adaptation after the pen move, which could impact the ewe's productivity and health.

Goat horns: Goats with horns are associated with fertility; however, in intensively confined farms, horns can easily cause their heads to become trapped in fences, potentially leading to serious injuries during fights. Furthermore, horns often make it difficult for goats to feed through the feed trough.

Horn Buds: After birth, lambs should be dehorned by four days of age. Female lambs are slightly more susceptible to dehorning than male lambs, so male lambs should be dehorned by two days of age. Delaying dehorning is painful for lambs and reduces the success rate. In mature rams, regenerated horns often become scars. Poorly regenerated horns often grow in curls. If dehorning is performed at this time, care should be taken to ensure that the horn retains vascularized areas and avoid excessive bleeding.

Horn growth: To identify the growth point of the lamb's horns, you can observe that the hair on the horn-growing part of the top of its head will appear in a swirl shape, and when you touch it with your hand, you can feel a hard protrusion. When the hair is cut off, you can see small white protrusions.

Horn bud removal methods: First, the lamb must be restrained. This typically requires two people: one person holds the lamb in place while the other removes the horn. Other methods, such as cauterization or chemical dehorning, can be used. 1. Cauterization: First, use scissors to remove the hair at the horn bud site. Then, place a red-hot iron around the base of the horn, working until the periosteum is removed and the keratin is broken. Each cauterization lasts 10 to 15 seconds, and complete removal takes 3 to 5 minutes. After surgery, it is best to spray the horn site with iodine disinfectant daily to accelerate wound healing. 2. Corrosion: First, use scissors to remove the hair at the horn bud site. Apply petroleum jelly around the horn bud to prevent injury to the affected area and to prevent the drug from getting into the eyes. Then, use a blade to make a well-shaped cut on both sides to induce slight bleeding. Then, apply cauterizing potash or sodium hydroxide to corrode the skin. After restraining the horn for 30 minutes, rinse the wound with acetic acid and finally rinse with clean water. After surgery, it is best to spray the area where the horn buds are removed with disinfectant iodine solution every day to accelerate wound healing.

Hoof Trimming: Goats' hooves are constantly growing. Removing and trimming the horn and flesh on the hoof bottom allows the goats to stand steadily on flat surfaces and maintain foot health, extending their lifespan. Hoof trimming can easily lead to hoof deformation, which can seriously cause lameness, an unsteady gait, and difficulty moving, which in turn reduces the goat's appetite. In late pregnancy, the rapidly growing fetus compresses the ewe's gastrointestinal space for feed, naturally reducing her appetite. Therefore, her hoof must be in good shape to prevent further impact on her feeding. Another common hoof deformation is the ingrown horn on the outer edge, which can trap foreign matter, feces, and dirt. If this causes injury, it can lead to bacterial infection. These bacteria thrive in long, damp hooves and can spread to the entire flock. Deformed hooves often resist restoration after prolonged neglect, so regular hoof trimming is essential. It is generally recommended to begin hoof trimming at around six weeks of age or earlier, with inspections every four weeks. Do not trim the hooves of pregnant ewes within two months of giving birth to avoid causing stress or pressure on the abdomen, which can lead to miscarriage. If goats are raised on pasture, the hooves wear less frequently due to the soft grass, so the frequency of hoof trimming must be increased appropriately.

Reasons for hoof trimming: The goal of hoof trimming is to make the bottom of the hoof parallel to the angle of the coronal band, so that the side of the hoof has a trapezoidal appearance and the bottom of the hoof is approximately elliptical, so that the meat of the hoof is flat and in contact with the ground.

Hoof trimming steps: 1. Secure the sheep in a standing position, leaving space on one side of the body for trimming, and place the other side against a wall or fence. 2. To trim the front foot: Face the sheep from behind, grasp the joint of the hoof with your left hand, and using your knee as a fulcrum, bend the front foot upward and backward, with the sole facing up. 3. To trim the hind foot: Position yourself close to the hip. Because the hock cannot be used as a fulcrum for bending upward and backward, the operator must lift the entire hind leg with the sole facing up. Be careful not to lift the hind leg too high, and never pull it outward from the sheep's body, as this may cause discomfort and resistance. 4. Clean the hoof of any foreign matter to help distinguish the horny (harder) from the fleshy (softer) area. 5. Trim the hoof in accordance with the normal hoof shape, trimming any horny material that protrudes beyond the fleshy area, allowing the fleshy area of the hoof to rest flat on the ground. 6. Excessive fleshy growth, usually at the heel, should also be trimmed. The goal is to even the fleshy area with the horny surface of the hoof. However, trim only small amounts at a time to avoid cutting into the vascular area of the fleshy area. 7. In cases of extreme hoof deformation, it is important to carefully distinguish between the horny and fleshy areas, and only trim a small amount of horny at a time to avoid removing too much fleshy area at once, which could cause accidental injury and bleeding.

Castration of goats: Young rams reach sexual maturity very early, with some being bred and pregnant at three months of age. If a ram is to be kept beyond three months of age, it is best to castrate it if it is not intended for breeding. Castration not only makes the ram more docile, but also reduces body odor, improves meat quality, and increases meat mass. The earlier castration is performed, the faster the recovery, and it is usually easiest to perform it within one to two weeks of birth.

There are two types of castration methods: 1. Surgical method: This method is best performed 1-2 weeks after the lamb is born. In surgical castration, the scrotum is cut open with a surgical blade and the testicles are removed. The wound is coated with disinfectant iodine solution to prevent inflammation. It is best to be performed by a veterinarian. 2. Bloodless castration methods are divided into two types: (1) Forceps and file method: Using castration forceps, the scrotum is cut at a right angle to the spermatic cord on the outside, crushing the blood vessels and vas deferens at the base of the scrotum. During the operation, be careful not to move the spermatic cord. Press the spermatic cord for 30-60 seconds before removing it. The scrotum needs to be disinfected and coated with disinfectant iodine solution. After a few weeks of the operation, the testicles can be felt to be smaller and harder. (2) Rubber band method: It is best to perform the operation within 1 week after birth. Use a special tool, expansion forceps (Figure 23), to open a thick, strong rubber band and place it above the scrotum, so that it remains at the base. Before the rubber band is released from the tool, make sure that both testicles are in the scrotum. This method stops blood circulation, causing the tissue inside the testicles or scrotum to shrink and necrotize, and fall off after a few weeks. This is the simplest and safest method of castration.


Reproduction: Reproduction is the same as reproduction. A prerequisite for a successful goat breeder is to be able to produce a large number of lambs each year and successfully raise them for sale. Although it is important for goats to have high-quality genetic composition, growth traits, and lactation traits, production is reproduction. Animals with low reproductive capacity or reproductive disorders will increase costs significantly. Those that cannot reproduce successfully even with relevant artificial assisted reproductive technology must be eliminated.

The ewe's reproductive system is divided into the vulva: The vulva is the external part of the reproductive tract, also known as the vulva or vulva. It is located below the anus and connected to the perineum. It consists of three parts: the labia vulva, the clitoris, and the vestibule. The vagina: The vagina, located from the vulva to the inside of the body, receives and deposits semen during mating. It is also part of the birth canal and serves as a barrier to the reproductive tract, preventing bacteria and foreign matter from entering the uterus. The vagina is typically glandless, but it does contain mucus, which is secreted by the cervix and flows into the vagina. The uterus: The uterus is divided into three structures: the cervix, the uterine body, and the uterine horns. The cervix (cervix): Located between the vagina and uterus, it secretes mucus to trap bacteria and flush them out of the reproductive tract, forming a physical barrier and serving as the second barrier of the reproductive system. The uterine corpus (Uterus) and uterine horns: The goat's uterus is bicornuate (Figure 2), with a small corpus and uterine horns primarily responsible for the development of the fetus. The uterine corpus and horns are composed of three layers of tissue: the endometrium, which nourishes the fetus and is composed of a single layer of columnar epithelium, glands, and connective tissue. The myometrium, composed of circular muscles and extremely thick, helps push the fetus out of the uterus during birth. The perimetrium, formed by extensions of the peritoneum, provides support and attachment to the mother. Ruminants such as cattle and sheep have a specialized tissue within the uterus called the caruncle. This gland-less tissue is rich in blood vessels and serves as the attachment point for the cotyledonous lobes, supplying oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. The oviduct projects outward from the uterus and is where fertilization occurs. It provides a pathway for sperm to reach the egg. After the egg is released from the ovary, it is transported to the uterus via the oviduct. The oviduct's front end extends outward to form the infundibulum, a funnel-like structure sometimes called a trumpet tube. Its function is to catch the egg, released by the rupture of a mature ovarian follicle, and transport it to the oviduct and uterus. The ovary is the most important structure of the reproductive system. Goats have two ovaries, each containing numerous follicles at varying stages of maturity. When the follicle matures, it releases the egg. In addition to producing eggs, the ovaries are also important endocrine organs in females, primarily secreting estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen primarily influences the development and growth of female reproductive organs, promoting oogenesis, follicular development, stimulating corpus luteum growth, and promoting estrus. Progesterone, secreted primarily by the corpus luteum cells of the ovaries, promotes endometrial thickening and secretion, and supports pregnancy. The most important structure in the ovaries is the follicle, which can be categorized by size and shape into primary, secondary, tertiary, and Graafian (or vesicular) follicles.

The reproductive structure of a ram is primarily composed of the testes (testis) . Paired, the testes are located within the scrotum . A mature ram's testis weighs approximately 100-150 grams. Attached to the upper edge of the testis is the epididymis (epididymis), which contains the head of the testis and a vascular plexus at the anterior end and the tail of the testis at the posterior end . The epididymis is covered with a thick connective tissue rich in blood vessels , called the tunica albuginea . The testis is divided into numerous lobules by the tunica albuginea . The seminiferous tubules (tubuli seminiferi) are located within the testicular parenchyma and function to produce sperm and secrete androgen. The epididymis (epididymis) stores and matures sperm , confers fertilizing ability , and transports sperm from the testis to the vas deferens. Accessory sex glands : These include the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands. Their primary function is to secrete seminal plasma, which contains sugars that nourish sperm and cleanse and protect the male urethra. Penis: The end of a ram's penis has a structure called the urethral process, which is an extension of the urethra beyond the end of the penis. The penis is the primary organ of copulation, protected by the foreskin. Its primary function is to transfer semen to the ewe's vagina during mating. A ram's penis is normally retracted within the body and only extends when the ram is aroused. The scrotum is a muscular sac that houses the testicles and epididymis . From the outside in, it consists of the cortical muscular membrane (which contains sweat and sebaceous glands), the scrotal fascia, and the common capsule . Its function is to protect the testicles and epididymis , and through scrotal contraction, it regulates the distance between the testicles and the body to maintain an appropriate temperature , which is beneficial for spermatogenesis . However, it should be noted that if the ambient temperature exceeds 39 ° C , goats cannot regulate their own cooling.

Puberty: Puberty is the age at which a male or female goat first comes into estrus, signifying that the gonads have begun producing gametes (sperm and eggs), but sexual maturity still takes several weeks. Puberty timing varies depending on breed, nutrition, and season of birth. Generally, goats puberty between four and six months of age, but breeding is not recommended until they reach at least 60-70% of their mature weight to avoid hampering subsequent growth and increasing the risk of dystocia.

Seasonal estrus: Goats are seasonal, short-day breeding animals. Autumn and winter are their breeding seasons. When the daylight hours begin to increase in spring and in the summer, reproductive activity slows down or stops.

When a ewe is in estrus, she will rapidly wag her tail, bleat, become restless, move around, eat less, and experience swelling and redness of the vulva. Increased vaginal discharge can make the vulva appear damp, dirty, and cloudy, with discharge sometimes hanging from the vulva. To confirm a ewe's estrus, a ram will sniff and lick her vulva, displaying Flehmen behavior, where the ram's upper lip lifts and sniffs. Rams also often test the ewe's receptivity by kicking her with their front legs and licking or biting her shoulders and back. If the ewe does not resist, he mounts her and completes the copulation, ejaculating. The entire process typically lasts no more than two minutes.

Estrus Cycle: After estrus, ewes begin to undergo cyclical changes in their reproductive physiology. These physiological changes from the onset of estrus to the next estrus are called the estrus cycle. The estrus cycle is divided into four phases: proestrus: the stage before estrus, lasting approximately 2-4 days. During this period, progesterone levels decrease, while follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is secreted, stimulating follicle growth. Simultaneously, estrogen levels begin to gradually rise, triggering estrus. Estrous: the period of sexual receptivity. Under the influence of estrogen, ewes allow males to ride and mate without avoiding them. The estrus period lasts approximately 30 hours, but can vary by several hours between individuals. During estrus, ewes may be seen swinging their tails rapidly, approaching rams, howling, and possibly riding other ewes. Ovulation occurs a few hours after the estrus period ends. Metoestrus (metoestrus) can last for 3-5 days. Ovulation usually occurs during this period. After ovulation, the follicle transforms into a corpus luteum and begins to secrete progesterone. Ewes may be seen exhibiting silent behavior and avoiding being ridden by rams.
And dioestrus: Diestrus, also known as anestrus, lasts about 10-14 days. It is the stage of entering the next estrus. At this time, the vaginal epithelial cells are not keratinized, and the corpus luteum secretes a large amount of progesterone to maintain the integrity of the endometrium for embryo implantation and development.

To achieve fertilization, sperm must undergo capacitation and acrosome reactions before they can penetrate the oocyte's zona pellucida and complete fertilization. If sperm undergo capacitation and acrosome reactions too early before fertilization, their fertilizing ability will be reduced.

Fertilization : When a mature egg reaches the fertilization site , a cluster of granular vesicles , known as the corona radiata and cumulus cells , still surround the oocyte 's zona pellucida . In most mammals, the cumulus cells disintegrate within a few hours after ovulation. When the sperm collides with the egg , the sperm head releases hyaluronidase or acrosin , enhancing its ability to penetrate the cumulus cells. As the sperm penetrates the zona pellucida , the sperm cap also contains proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin-like enzymes , aiding passage through the zona. As the sperm passes through the zona pellucida , it loses its cell membrane , and the outer membrane of the cap gradually peels away . By the time the sperm reaches the vitelline membrane , the cap has completely fallen off. Oocytes in higher mammals typically only allow fertilization by a single sperm to prevent polyspermy. After the first sperm passes through the zona pellucida, the yolk cortex changes, preventing further sperm from passing through the zona pellucida . This is called the zona reaction. Due to poor zona reaction in aging mammalian oocytes, multiple sperm penetration often occurs, hindering the normal development of the fertilized egg and representing a pathological condition.

Capacitation : After mating, sperm is ejaculated from the male body and exposed to the female reproductive tract for a period of time , passing through the cervix and into the uterus and fallopian tubes . During this time, the glycoproteins on the surface of the sperm cap are degraded by alpha- and beta- amylases in reproductive tract secretions. Simultaneously , the ratio of cholesterol to phosphatidylcholine in the cap membrane and its structure, as well as its membrane potential , change, reducing its stability. This allows the sperm to possess the ability to fertilize. In addition to capacitation , sperm undergo agglutination in the fallopian tube , which allows them to concentrate near the oocyte and increase their chances of attachment.

Acrosome reaction : The sperm cell membrane fuses with the outer membrane of the head cap. The contents of the head cap then flow out through the resulting pore. Typically , the head cap reaction occurs when the sperm encounters the zona pellucida. Once the sperm cell encounters the oocyte and reaches the zona pellucida , it undergoes the head cap reaction on its own , releasing increased amounts of hyaluronidase and other enzymes. These enzymes help the sperm head further penetrate the oocyte's zona pellucida.


Anterior pituitary: The anterior pituitary secretes follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH stimulates follicle growth in females and testicular sperm production in males. In females, LH stimulates ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum in the ovary. In males, LH stimulates testosterone secretion by the Leydig cells of the testes, leading to the male LH being called interstitial cell hormone. FSH and LH are collectively known as gonadotropins, also known as gonadotropins.

The hypothalamus regulates hormones and a negative feedback system: The hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is delivered to the anterior pituitary gland via the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system. Upon receiving GnRH, the anterior pituitary gland secretes FSH and LH, which are transported via the bloodstream to the gonads to stimulate the secretion of sex steroids (estradiol and progesterone from the ovaries, and testosterone from the testes). However, when blood levels of these sex steroids become too high, they are transported to the anterior pituitary gland, inhibiting FSH and LH secretion. Furthermore, they are transported to the hypothalamus, inhibiting GnRH secretion, creating a negative feedback mechanism.

Pregnancy: Pregnancy begins with fertilization and ends with birth. After fertilization, the embryo begins cell division, forming a morula. The embryo then travels down the fallopian tube through the tubouterine junction to the uterus, where it implants and develops. This occurs approximately 15-20 days after fertilization, and is when most pregnancies terminate. If the pregnancy is terminated at this time, the ewe will return to estrus. The average gestation period for ewes is 150 days (approximately five months). The second half of pregnancy is generally uneventful, but in the last third of pregnancy, the rapid growth of the fetus increases the ewe's nutritional needs. During this period, attention must be paid to feed quality. The growing fetus takes up space in the abdomen and compresses the rumen, making it difficult for the ewe to consume large amounts of feed. Therefore, a high-quality feed is especially important during this period to ensure sufficient energy supply even with reduced feed intake. Insufficient energy intake during this period can lead to pregnancy toxemia, which can lead to death and significant losses. Therefore, before breeding, it is necessary to pay attention to the body shape of the ewes to be bred, and adjust the body shape of ewes that are too thin or too fat during pregnancy to cope with subsequent production and management.

Delivery: Goats deliver approximately 150 days after mating. Observe the ewe's abdomen and udder swelling. Some ewes may begin to secrete fluid from their nipples, gradually changing from amber to milky white. The hip ligaments begin to soften and stretch, signaling the onset of labor. As labor approaches, the ewe's vulva may swell and become sticky with discharge. The ewe may also become restless, kicking and stopping eating. During delivery, the cervix dilates and the uterus contracts, causing the amniotic membrane to rupture and the release of amniotic fluid. This phase can last for several hours. As the uterine contractions push the fetus into the birth canal, the lamb is quickly expelled from the mother's body. In a normal fetal position, the lamb's head and front feet emerge first. If the front feet are visible but not delivered within an hour, it indicates a difficult labor and requires assistance. After the fetus is delivered, the mother will expel the afterbirth and allantois (Figure 9). The entire delivery process, from start to finish, takes several to 12 hours. In most cases, the ewe can complete the delivery naturally.


Puberty: Puberty refers to the age at which goats are able to release gametes (sperm and eggs) and mate. Puberty typically occurs between 4 and 20 months of age, with the timing affected by factors such as breed, size, crossbreeding, inbreeding, health, nutritional status, and season of birth. Puberty does not necessarily indicate full maturity; most goats must reach two-thirds of their mature weight before their first breeding. Rams typically puberty between 4 and 6 months of age, but are more consistent between 5 and 7 months. Larger breeds tend to puberty more slowly than smaller ones, and within the same breed, faster-growing goats tend to puberty earlier than slower-growing ones.

Sexual maturity: Goats generally reach sexual maturity between 8 and 10 months of age, at which point their bodies and reproductive organs reach full development, and their reproductive function becomes fully developed, enabling them to reproduce normally. The age and state of sexual maturity are influenced by factors such as breed (hybrid > purebred, dairy > meat, native > exotic), individual differences (female > male), and the natural environment (excellent > adverse).

Mature and Age-Adapted: Physical maturity refers to the age at which a goat reaches adult weight and all organs are fully developed and functioning normally. Sexual maturity generally precedes physical maturity, with females typically reaching physical maturity after giving birth to one or two litters. Suitable breeding age is determined artificially based on the ram's developmental status and intended use. Generally, first breeding should occur in the late stages of sexual maturity or even later.

Seasonality: Goats are seasonal estrus animals, generally reaching peak reproduction between September and January. The reproductive performance of both rams and ewes is affected by light exposure. Goats are not infertile in spring and summer, but their behavior and symptoms are less pronounced than in the autumn and winter breeding seasons, and the reproductive system and behavioral signs are also less pronounced.

Libido : A ram's libido, vitality, and breeding ability play a crucial role in reproductive efficiency . A ram with a high libido can breed with a larger number of ewes during the breeding season. Factors such as the sheep's body condition, genetics, ambient temperature, disease, and parasites can all influence libido. Generally , it's appropriate for one ram to breed with 50 or fewer ewes during a breeding season . Breeding with too many ewes will cause the ram to consume excessive body mass and energy during the breeding season , affecting both breeding success rates and the ram's subsequent useful life.

Heredity: As with other species, certain goat breeds or goats with certain genes have a higher rate of multiple births. For example, the Nubian breed has a higher rate of triplets than other breeds. Furthermore, through selection and screening, the multiple birth rate of a flock can be improved.

Age: Age will affect the reproductive capacity of ewes. Generally, the reproductive capacity of ewes reaches its best when they are 3-5 years old , and the twin rate of ewes at the age of 4 years old will be higher than that of ewes at the age of 2 years old.

Temperature : When temperatures exceed 32 °C for a sustained period , embryo survival and subsequent fetal development decrease . High temperatures in late pregnancy may result in smaller and weaker lambs. Heat stress in rams can cause decreased sperm concentration and motility, and increased rates of malformations . Prolonged exposure to temperatures exceeding 35 ° C can lead to reduced fertility or infertility.

Nutrition: Optimal nutritional management can improve the reproductive capacity of ewes. Besides genetics and breed, ewe size is also determined by nutrition. Larger ewes within the same breed tend to have a higher rate of multiple births compared to smaller ewes. A good nutritional balance helps improve conception rates, maintain pregnancy, and reduce the incidence of acute metabolic disorders in late pregnancy. However, it's important not to blindly supplement nutrition. Overweight or underweight ewes can reduce conception success rates, and overweight ewes may suffer losses such as dystocia.

The reproductive physiology of ewes indicates that they begin puberty at an average age of 5 to 7 months, with an average range of 5 to 20 months. The average estrus cycle is 21 days, with a range of 15 to 24 days. Each estrus period lasts approximately 30 hours, but can actually be over between 24 and 48 hours. After giving birth, estrus returns approximately 33 hours later, typically between 30 and 40 hours. The average gestation period is 149 days, with a range of 144 to 155 days. The average litter size is 1.5 lambs, but the actual litter size can range from 1 to 4. The recommended time for breeding is when the ewe reaches 60-75% of its adult body weight.

Rams have reproductive characteristics. Their average puberty age is 4 to 6 months, with a range of 5 to 20 months. They are ready for breeding at an average age of 8 to 10 months, with a practical range of 6 to 12 months. A mature ram can breed an average of 40 ewes, with a range of 35 to 60. A young ram under one year old can breed an average of 20 ewes, with a practical range of 10 to 25. Rams produce approximately 6 million sperm per day, with a range of 4.8 to 7.2 million. The average ejaculate volume is 1 ml, with a range of 0.5 to 1.5 ml. The average sperm concentration in semen is 3.01 million sperm per ml, with a range of 0.5 to 6 million.

Breeding methods can be categorized into natural breeding: During the estrus season, both rams and ewes experience peak sexual hormone production and reproductive activity. Lambs born during this period are healthier and more efficient than those produced during the off-season. Generally, a mature ram can mate with 35-60 ewes during the breeding season. Artificial insemination: Artificial insemination is not restricted by season, but estrus synchronization is often required to ensure a consistent estrus period within a short period of time for easier artificial insemination. Frozen semen in Taiwan is mostly imported from France or Australia. This semen is sourced from rams with proven progeny. Sheep farmers can select semen based on their flock's future breeding direction to improve their performance. Artificial light regulation: Light regulation mimics the natural daylight variations of summer and autumn to induce estrus. Lighting adjustment takes four months. If the ewes are scheduled for breeding in May, a lighting adjustment plan should be implemented starting in January. The method involves installing fluorescent lights in an open-plan sheep pen at an appropriate height above the bedding surface. Adjust the light intensity to a specific level at the sheep's eye level. A timer is then set to turn on the lights one hour before sunset and off for four hours at midnight. During the day, the sheep receive natural light for a total of 20 hours of light per day. This process is repeated for two months, followed by a two-month wait. This method allows the sheep to enter estrus during the non-breeding season, thereby adjusting the time for winter milk or winter mutton to be marketed.

Artificial insemination: Artificial insemination involves the use of both human and mechanical assistance to inject ram semen into the female reproductive tract without direct contact between the goats. The main reasons for its limited adoption in the goat industry are the small scale of the industry, the low economic benefits of artificial insemination, and the need to maintain rams for semen collection. Furthermore, the success rate of pregnancy in ewes is low when the semen used for artificial insemination is frozen-thawed semen. However, with advancements in artificial insemination technology, its effectiveness has significantly improved. Ultimately, however, it remains crucial to adapt to producer needs and be flexible to increase industry acceptance.

The advantages of artificial insemination technology are as follows: (1) It can increase the genetic performance of the population: Producers are usually most concerned about how to improve the continuation of the excellent genetic performance of sheep, or how to spread excellent genetic traits in the flock. Current selection is usually carried out on males, because males can produce far more offspring than females in their life history. The production traits of excellent males will directly affect the performance of their offspring. If the selection program continues, it will have a long-term impact on the performance improvement of future generations. Under natural breeding conditions, each male can breed 50-100 females a year, but if fresh semen is diluted and artificially inseminated through the cervix, more than 1,000 females can be bred in 2-3 weeks. Even if the success rate of artificial insemination is not as good as natural breeding, the ability of excellent males to transmit genetic material is still several times better than natural breeding. (2) Quick and easy transmission of genetic material: Breeders usually hope to introduce new bloodlines into their own flocks. Compared with directly purchasing breeding rams, semen is the cheapest, fastest and most effective way to avoid the spread of diseases. Frozen semen allows excellent genetic material to be exchanged and used around the world without being restricted by distance . (3) Semen can be stored for a long time: Semen can be stored in liquid nitrogen for permanent preservation, and its excellent genetic material can be effectively preserved even after the death of the ram. (4) Improve breeding efficiency: Artificial insemination can ensure that every female animal is fertilized and avoid missed breeding. New female sheep often have silent estrus and their estrus symptoms are not obvious. Using artificial insemination can improve the success rate of breeding for female sheep during their first estrus. (5) Reduce or avoid ram maintenance costs: Small farms do not need to maintain rams, reducing the time, space and cost required to manage rams. (6) Reduce and control the spread of diseases: Artificial insemination does not require direct contact between males and females, which can avoid the spread of diseases, but it can only prevent the spread of diseases and has no function of treating diseases. (7) Improve the efficiency of using goats that have lost their ability to breed: Some rams with excellent performance may be affected by genital injuries or old age, which may affect their breeding behavior. However, artificial insemination technology can still be used to enable them to continue to reproduce. (8) Accurately record breeding information: Artificial insemination can accurately record the breeding time, so the time of delivery can be accurately calculated, or adverse genetic traits can be prevented from being introduced into the flock. (9) Use estrus synchronization to breed in the non-breeding season: Goats are seasonal estrus animals, but in order to meet the market demand for milk or meat, they must be bred in the non-breeding season to meet production timelines. Because the quality of ram semen in the non-breeding season is poor, frozen semen must be used for artificial insemination to achieve this goal.

The disadvantages of artificial insemination technology are as follows: (1) Inbreeding: High selection intensity is often accompanied by increased inbreeding, which reduces genetic variation and leads to the adverse effects of inbreeding. (2) Potential breeding errors: Incorrect labeling of straws during the production of frozen semen may lead to the subsequent use of incorrectly labeled ram semen. (3) Disease transmission: If diseases that can be transmitted through semen are not screened before being produced into frozen semen, then diseases can be spread through artificial insemination, and this hazard spreads faster and wider than natural breeding. (4) Reduced reproductive efficiency: Compared with natural breeding, the reproductive efficiency of artificial insemination is lower, especially when estrus synchronization is carried out or when semen is improperly stored during artificial insemination, which will aggravate this phenomenon. (5) Cost: As with any technology applied to the sheep industry, the initial cost will increase, but as the technology becomes more proficient and the additional benefits generated by the implementation of the technology increase, the cost will gradually decrease.

Semen quality assessment: Semen consists of sperm (15%) and seminal plasma (85%). Semen quality assessment can be divided into basic semen characteristics and sperm performance assessment. Basic semen characteristics include semen volume, color, sperm concentration, pH, and osmotic pressure; sperm performance assessment includes motility and activity parameters, survival rate, head cap integrity, mitochondrial potential, and DNA integrity.

Estrus observation and detection: Observing goat estrus plays a crucial role in artificial insemination. If the timing of estrus is well understood , the success rate of artificial insemination will be greatly improved.

To determine if a ewe is in estrus, here are nine characteristics to consider. 1. Frequent vocalization: Ewes don't normally make much noise, but those in estrus will make more vocalizations than usual. Nubian ewes are more vocal than other breeds, and if they haven't been bred by a ram, they may even mimic the ram's vocalizations. 2. Tail wag: When in estrus, ewes will wag their tails rapidly. They will also allow their tails to be grasped without resistance. 3. Personality changes in estrus: Hormonal changes can cause a change in the personality of ewes, and normally docile ewes may exhibit aggressive behavior toward other sheep. 4. Sticky and dirty tail: In estrus, the ventral side of the tail will be red and swollen, accompanied by a sticky vaginal discharge. If the hair on both sides of the tail is sticky or clumped together, and there is no evidence of illness, this indicates estrus. 5. Changes in milk production: Normally milked ewes in estrus may occasionally refuse to enter the milking parlor. If a ram is forced to penetrate, the ewe's milk supply will decrease, accompanied by a loss of appetite. 6. Mounting Other Ewes: If a ewe cannot wait for a ram to mount her, she will mount other ewes or allow them to mount her. When another ewe sniffs the genitals of an estrus ewe, she will respond by raising her tail. 7. Frequent Urinary: When a ewe is in estrus, she will urinate more frequently than usual. This urine contains chemicals (pheromones) that tell the ram she is waiting to be bred. If a ram is introduced, he will lick the ewe's urine with his muzzle, then raise his head and raise his upper lip (Flemen's response) to pick up the ewe's estrus scent. 8. Stable Standing of the Ewe: If a ewe is not in stable estrus, she will not accept being mounted by a ram and will flee if he attempts to mount her. If a ewe accepts being mounted by a ram, she is in stable estrus. 9. Vaginal Mucus Changes: The average duration of estrus in ewes is 30 hours. However, during artificial insemination, even if the ewe is receptive to the ram, it is still necessary to observe the condition of the vaginal mucus. Generally, clear vaginal mucus indicates the beginning of estrus, thick and slightly turbid mucus indicates the middle stage, and cloudy mucus indicates the optimal time for artificial insemination.

Estrus detection: The sheep used for estrus detection can be divided into three categories: (1) Using normal rams that have not been vasectomized. When using this type of ram, wrap a cloth around their abdomen (the penis must be covered) to prevent the penis from being inserted during detection. (2) Using vasectomized rams. The advantage of this type of ram is that you do not need to worry about whether they actually ejaculate, because the ejaculated semen does not contain sperm, only seminal plasma. (3) Using ewes that are injected with hormones to make them behave like rams. This method is very stressful for the sheep because it uses a large amount of hormones artificially injected. Once the injection is stopped, the ewe's male-like behavior will disappear, so this method is not recommended.

Artificial insemination techniques can be divided into four main categories based on the location of semen insertion: intravaginal artificial insemination, intracervical artificial insemination, intrauterine artificial insemination, and laparoscopic artificial insemination. The success rate of artificial insemination increases with deeper insertion into the uterus. The key to successful artificial insemination is timing. The estrus period of a typical ewe lasts 12-36 hours, and ovulation occurs approximately four hours after the ewe has stabilized and can be ridden by a ram and then regains a position where it cannot be ridden by a ram. Therefore, the optimal time for artificial insemination is between 12 and 24 hours after the ewe is stable and can be ridden. Before artificial insemination, estrus synchronization is typically performed to ensure that the ewes are in estrus at a similar time, reducing both time and cost. The following describes the methods of estrus synchronization and artificial insemination.

Estrus synchronization: The most commonly used method for estrus synchronization currently involves inserting a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) intravaginally, marking day 0. On day 9, intramuscular injection of 400-500 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and 0.5 mL of prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2a) is administered. The CIDR is removed on day 11, and estrus is detected using a test ram or ewe on day 12. Artificial insemination is typically performed 37-43 hours after CIDR removal.

The instruments required for artificial insemination are: constant temperature water tank, artificial insemination gun, lubricant, vaginal opener, light source, straw cutter and insemination gun sleeve. The operation steps of artificial insemination are divided into three parts: (1) Ewe restraint: pull the ewe to the artificial insemination restraint frame, fix the neck of the sheep with a neck clamp, lift the sheep's hind legs and fix them on the restraint frame to complete the sheep restraint. (2) Thawing of frozen semen and loading of artificial insemination gun: If the semen used is frozen thawed semen, first take the semen out of the liquid nitrogen storage barrel and put it into a 37℃ constant temperature water bath for 30 seconds to thaw. After the thawed straw is thoroughly dried with a paper towel, cut the powdered end of the straw with a straw cutter. Insert the open end into the artificial insemination gun sleeve, then put on the artificial insemination gun, push the straw to the bottom, and pull the buckle at the end of the insemination gun back to make the sleeve and the insemination gun stable. The artificial insemination gun with the semen device should be placed in a pocket or in a dark place to avoid direct sunlight before insemination. (3) Semen injection: After properly lubricating the front end of the vaginal opener, lift the sheep's tail and slowly insert the vaginal opener into the vagina, stretching the vagina. After finding the cervical opening, insert the artificial insemination gun from the cervical opening at a downward angle of about 15 degrees. If there is an obstacle, you can swing the insemination gun to try to pass through. If it still cannot pass, do not force it, and place the semen at the obstacle. The best place to place the semen is in the uterine cavity, but only a few sheep can successfully place it. Do not use brute force when performing artificial insemination, otherwise the immune response caused by vaginal or cervical bleeding will be extremely unfavorable for insemination.

Pregnancy Diagnosis: If a ewe returns to estrus after artificial insemination, it can be observed 18-24 days after artificial insemination (a new estrus cycle ). Ultrasound scanning is usually performed 45 days after artificial insemination. If the placenta has formed at this time, the uterine funiculus will be clearly visible. Blood tests for pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) can also be performed 28-35 days after artificial insemination, with an accuracy rate of approximately 99.3%.


Sperm cryoprotectants: The main function of cryoprotectants is to prevent or reduce the physical and chemical damage to sperm during freezing and thawing. Cryoprotectants can be divided into two categories: permeable and non-permeable: (1) Permeable cryoprotectants. Common permeable cryoprotectants include glycerol, ethylene glycol, dimethylsulfonate, and propylene glycol, among which glycerol is the most commonly used. This type of cryoprotectant acts as a solute during cell freezing, achieving the purpose of dehydrating sperm. The water content inside the cell decreases, the freezing point drops, and the amount of ice crystal formation is reduced, thereby reducing damage to sperm. In addition, permeable cryoprotectants can also increase the permeability of the cell membrane, which is more conducive to sperm dehydration and thus improves the survival rate of sperm after freezing and thawing. However, the final concentration (v/v) of these cryoprotectants and the equilibrium time and temperature need to be determined based on their toxicity and the effect on the quality of semen after sperm freezing and thawing. The toxicity of the four cryoprotectants mentioned above is as follows: propylene glycol is the most toxic, followed by dimethyl sulfoxide, then ethylene glycol, and the least toxic is glycerol. (2) Permeable cryoprotectants. The most commonly used non-permeable cryoprotectants are egg yolk, skim milk powder, and sugars. These cryoprotectants cannot penetrate the sperm cell membrane and therefore only function outside the cell. Their functions are to modify the sperm cell membrane, dehydrate, and lower the freezing temperature of semen during freezing.

Semen Collection: Semen can generally be collected using an artificial vagina. This artificial vagina consists of a hard rubber cylinder lined with a rubber sleeve . Warm water at approximately 45 °C can be pumped in between the rubber and hard walls, and air blown into the lining to expand , thereby simulating the temperature and pressure conditions found in a ewe's vagina. Alternatively, electrostimulation can be used. This method requires restraining the ram and using an electrostimulator. After restraint, the foreskin is cleansed with saline to prevent contaminants from entering the semen. The collector stands at the ram's side . Another assistant lubricates the tip of an electrode rod and inserts it directly into the rectum through the anus, adjusting the current intensity. Initially , a low-voltage current is applied through the rectum to stimulate the reproductive tract muscles . The ram experiences a strong stiffness when the current is applied , but returns to normal when the stimulation ceases . Stimulation is typically repeated, with brief intervals of low current followed by a higher current , to induce ejaculation.

Sperm Freezing and Thawing: After removing the seminal plasma from the ram semen , add the appropriate amount of first-stage goat cryoprotectant diluent based on the sperm concentration at room temperature. Transfer to a 4 °C cold room to equilibrate for 2 hours. Then, add an equal amount of second-stage goat cryoprotectant diluent ( glycerol is added to the first-stage goat cryoprotectant diluent , which is divided into three equal parts , with 10- minute intervals between additions ) . After adding the second-stage diluent, let the mixture stand for 50 minutes. The semen is then transferred into 0.5mL French straws , sealed with PVC sealing powder, and frozen in a computer-programmed automatic freezer/cooler pre-cooled to 4 °C . The straws are then placed in liquid nitrogen for storage. Thawing procedures: After removing the frozen semen from the liquid nitrogen tank , immediately place it in a 37 °C water bath for 30 seconds to thaw.

Oocyte and Embryo Freezing and Thawing: The application value of oocyte and embryo cryopreservation technology not only accelerates livestock herd improvement and increases the commercial value of livestock, as well as facilitates disease control in seed import and export, but also provides a technical platform for in vitro embryo production, embryo transfer, nuclear transposition, and transgenic animal research in artificial reproductive technology. It can also be used to preserve the gene pool of elite breeds, rare mammals, or any individual, enhancing livestock stock diversity. It also facilitates the transfer of livestock embryos produced in vitro and in vivo without time or space constraints, achieving the goal of rapidly expanding high-quality livestock herds. The freezing efficiency of embryos or eggs is still affected by various factors, including cryoprotectant toxicity, intracellular ice crystals, fragmentation damage, and changes in osmotic pressure. Commercial frozen embryo production has been relatively successful in cattle and sheep.

Freezing methods for oocytes and embryos: (1) Slow freezing: This freezing method mainly involves placing oocytes and embryos in 0.25 mL straws , placing them in a programmed cooling device , and allowing the temperature to drop to -6 °C and then stop at this temperature . At this time, the liquid in the straw will not freeze . Then, an ice-planting action is performed ( knocking the straw or using an object with a lower temperature to touch the straw wall ), and the liquid in the straw freezes instantly. This action is intended to accelerate the freezing rate of the liquid and speed up the time it takes to pass through the ice crystal formation zone (-1 to -5 °C ) , and then continue to cool to -80 °C. The advantages of this method are low concentration of cryoprotectant, low toxicity to cells, and low damage to the osmotic pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cell membrane. However, the disadvantages are that the freezing rate is still not fast enough , resulting in greater damage to the embryonic cell membrane and organelles caused by ice crystal formation, expensive equipment, and time-consuming and complicated processing. (2) Vitrification: This method uses a cooling rate of up to -25,000 °C per minute to freeze . This method is usually carried out with a higher concentration of cryoprotectant because a high concentration of cryoprotectant can provide a better cooling rate for vitrification. Successful vitrification can produce a transparent solid structure with almost no ice crystal formation. The advantages of this method are that the freezing rate is extremely fast and there is almost no ice crystal formation , so the damage to cells is minimal, the required equipment and processing procedures are extremely simple and inexpensive , and the processing time is only more than ten minutes. However, the disadvantage is that a high concentration of cryoprotectant is required , which has a greater damage to cell toxicity and the osmotic pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cell membrane. Vitrification can take several forms according to the required carrier, such as : freezing ring, freezing plate, microscope net, hot-pull open straw and nylon net, etc. There is also a microdrop method that does not require a carrier. According to research, the embryonic development ability of those frozen using vitrification is significantly better after thawing than that of those frozen using general slow freezing, so vitrification has gradually replaced slow freezing.

Embryo transfer technology: Embryo transfer technology is an artificial reproductive technology that can rapidly expand purebred sheep flocks and significantly improve sheep production performance in the shortest possible time. However, this technology requires high operational skills and more careful personnel training, but it still has great commercial application value.

Estrus synchronization treatment: The estrus synchronization method for embryo transfer is the same as the estrus synchronization method for ewes during artificial insemination. The only difference is that the time of embryo transfer will be delayed by several days compared to the time of artificial insemination.

Ovarian Superovulation: The goal of superovulation is to increase the number of eggs released per ovary, facilitating oocyte or embryo collection. The procedure for superovulation is similar to estrus synchronization during artificial insemination, with the difference being that six intramuscular injections of FSH are administered daily, at 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM intervals, for three consecutive days from day 7 to day 9. The doses are 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, and 2 mg (a total of 16 mg). The final two doses of FSH are accompanied by an injection of 1.7 IU of LH.

Embryo Transfer Method: Thawed, viable goat embryos are surgically transferred into the uterine horn on the same side as the ovarian ovary. Pregnancy is confirmed 45 days after embryo transfer using an ultrasound scanner. Pregnancy is confirmed by imaging the uterine cavity and fetus.

Other assisted reproductive technologies include laparoscopic artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and sperm sexing. 1. Laparoscopic artificial insemination: Laparoscopic artificial insemination of sheep has been practiced for many years. This technique was initially developed to address the low pregnancy rates associated with traditional cervical insemination using frozen semen. Laparoscopic artificial insemination involves withholding water and food for 24-36 hours prior to the procedure. During the procedure, a sedative is injected intramuscularly. Once the sheep becomes unsteady, unable to stand, or falls asleep, it is restrained and the laparoscopic procedure performed. Laparoscopic artificial insemination typically involves two incisions: one for the imaging and lighting system and the other for the laparoscopic semen injection tube. Ovarian ovulation is monitored before injection . Semen is injected into the uterine horn on the ovulatory side, and pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound 45 days later. 2. In vitro embryo production: In vitro embryo production involves removing oocytes from goat ovaries, maturing them in vitro, fertilizing them, and culturing them in vitro. Once they reach a certain stage (blastocyst), they are transferred to a surrogate mother or cryopreserved. Currently, this method has a much lower success rate than embryos derived in vivo. 3. Sperm sex sorting: Using sexed semen for artificial insemination can increase the number of single-sex offspring born within a farm and even accelerate the rate of genetic improvement across all generations of goats. There are no significant differences in pregnancy length, fetal mortality, birth weight, or post-weaning survival rates between insemination with single-sex sperm and artificial insemination with standard semen. However, the disadvantages are that the sperm separation rate is still insufficient, and the sperm undergoes high dilution (5000 times), nuclear staining and culture, mechanical force (pressure), ultraviolet laser irradiation and electric field stimulation during the separation process, and subsequent spraying into the collection fluid (80-90 km/h) and centrifugation (700-1200g) after thawing, which reduces the sperm survival rate. In addition, the high production cost, the difficulty in obtaining semen from male animals with excellent traits, and the inability to conduct pre-analysis of relevant genes similar to that provided by early embryo sex identification are also important issues currently faced.

The process of in vitro embryo production can be divided into four steps: 1. Oocyte collection: Oocytes reside in ovarian follicles, so obtaining oocytes generally requires ovarian collection. Ovaries can be obtained from slaughterhouses, which can collect a larger number of ovaries and are more suitable for beginners. Alternatively, oocyte retrieval can be performed from live animals. Surgical oocyte collection can yield fewer oocytes, but the breed can be accurately determined. This is more suitable for applications requiring stricter control of results or for the preservation of high-quality stock. 2. Oocyte in vitro maturation: After oocyte collection, goat oocytes undergo 24 hours of in vitro maturation. After in vitro maturation, the cumulus cells transform from tightly packed to liquefied and diffused. Staining reveals the nucleus and the extruded first polar body. 3. Oocyte in vitro fertilization: Semen used for in vitro fertilization can be fresh semen, frozen-thawed semen, refrigerated semen, or sex-selected semen. After capacitation treatment, typically with heparin or caffeine, semen is co-cultured with oocytes for 18 hours. After staining, the second polar body, male pronucleus, and female pronucleus can be observed. 4. Embryo Culture in Vitro: Generally, embryonic cleavage can be observed 48 hours after fertilization. The embryo divides through multiple divisions, namely 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 (also known as the morula stage), and the 64-cell blastocyst stage. Development to the blastocyst stage typically takes seven days. Once the embryo has developed to the blastocyst stage, it can be transferred to a surrogate mother's uterus for pregnancy or frozen for future use.


Sheep breeding: The most important foundation of sheep breeding is health! It can usually be measured by several standards, including the performance of the sheep itself, the animal breeding environment, and the pathogens present around the animals . These three levels will affect each other and endanger the health of the sheep.

Key points of health management: There are several key points, namely, (1) health management of lambs, (2) reducing stress factors of the flock, (3) paying attention to pasture health management, (4) confirming the occurrence of diseases in sheep, (5) precautions for caring for sick sheep, (6) the necessary time for veterinarians to arrive for diagnosis and treatment, and (7) recording data in detail.

Lamb Health Management: Newborn lambs are particularly susceptible to disease because their immune systems haven't yet developed enough to fight pathogens. However, if lambs receive adequate colostrum after birth, they can obtain sufficient disease-fighting antibodies from their well-immunized dams. It's important to note that lambs' resistance to disease differs significantly from that of adult lambs, so try to avoid mixing lambs of varying ages. Furthermore, lambs are much more vulnerable to respiratory pathogens and environmental parasites than their dams, making them susceptible to contracting respiratory and parasitic diseases from apparently healthy ewes.

Reduce stress factors in sheep: Factors that cause stress in sheep flocks include bullying, overcrowding, long-distance transport, and the increasingly severe extreme climates, especially heat stress. Heat stress affects the sheep's brain nerves, stimulating the adrenal cortex to secrete cortisol into the bloodstream, which in turn affects the physiological performance of various internal organs. It also particularly weakens the sheep's immune system, leading to increased susceptibility to disease.

Emphasize farm health management: Veterinarians must collaborate with the farm to develop a specific sheep health plan based on the farm's objectives. These plans cover all stages of sheep husbandry, management, health care, and disease prevention. For example, regarding mastitis, the plan should include past mastitis cases and pathogen testing results, along with appropriate medical treatment and preventive measures for mastitis. Standard milking procedures should also be developed and implemented at least annually. A mastitis treatment process should also be established, specifically addressing strategies for handling various mastitis issues encountered during milking.

Identify the disease in sheep: If a sheep becomes ill, it is important to identify the disease immediately, as timely treatment can reduce the impact of the disease and minimize animal losses. Symptoms of sick sheep may include:
1. Loss of alertness and curiosity; 2. Decreased appetite, or shorter or no rumination ; 3. Dull eyes, dry nose, or abnormal eye and nasal discharge; 4. Dull, rough coat; 5. Changes in stool characteristics, such as lumps, mud, or water; 6. Rapid breathing rate or abnormal sounds when breathing; 7. Slow gait, staggering, or inability of the animal to walk in a straight line; 8. Decreased milk production, changes in milk characteristics, and redness and swelling of the udder.

Notes on caring for sick sheep: Veterinarians can only treat the initial onset of illness, or more seriously ill sheep, after which field personnel must continue the important work of caring for the sick sheep. There are a few points that require special attention:
1. Sick sheep, like sick people, particularly need a quiet environment, so it is best to isolate sick sheep from other sheep in the flock; 2. The isolated animal ward must be dry, bright and well-ventilated, and the floor must be clean or covered with clean bedding; 3. Provide clean drinking water, hay and concentrate; 4. Sheep are sometimes reluctant to stand up, so they must be assisted to stand to increase their food and water intake and recover quickly from the illness.

Every sheep manager or owner should be aware of the following: delaying medical attention can seriously endanger the sheep's life or even lead to more serious harm to the flock. Immediate veterinary attention is required in the following situations: fractures, severe bleeding, neurological symptoms, recumbency, suspected poisoning, uterine prolapse exposing the vulva, severe bloating, loss of appetite for more than 8-12 hours, lethargy, or a temperature below 36°C.

Detailed records: All health management or disease treatment must be recorded in detail in the health management record form for future tracking and treatment reference.


Sheep farm self-defense and epidemic prevention: Prevention is the most important thing for sheep diseases. Therefore, establishing a complete and implemented epidemic prevention system (self-defense and epidemic prevention plan) can effectively avoid the occurrence of diseases.

Key points for self-prevention and epidemic prevention: These self-prevention and epidemic prevention plans and work should include the following: (1) Animal breeding areas should be surrounded by fences, and entrances and exits should be equipped with cleaning and disinfection facilities, such as disinfection pools and automatic spray disinfection equipment, for personnel and vehicles. Animal transport vehicles, feed trucks, chemical processing plant collection trucks, and visitor vehicles are strictly prohibited from entering the area . When necessary, they must undergo a rigorous cleaning and disinfection process before entering. Animal sheds should be disinfected regularly, at least weekly. Do not mix more than two disinfectants when preparing disinfectants before disinfection. When vacating animal sheds, they must be thoroughly cleaned and allowed to dry. After disinfection, they should be flame sterilized and then sprayed with disinfectant. After cleaning and disinfection, the shed should be vacant for at least one week before introducing animals. It is best to disinfect the shed again before moving animals in. (2) In principle, visitors are prohibited from entering the breeding area. If necessary, they must at least change clothes or rubber shoes and disinfect their footwear before entering. (3) A quarantine area should be established outside the breeding area to house and quarantine newly introduced animals. Newly introduced animals should be kept in the quarantine area for at least 3-4 weeks to ensure they are healthy and free of potential infection before they can be moved into the herd. (4) Sheep must be vaccinated to obtain sufficient antibodies to fight disease. After the foot-and-mouth disease vaccine was withdrawn on July 1, 2018, the only annual vaccine required for domestic sheep is the sheep pox vaccine. Sheep over 4 months of age should receive a full annual sheep pox vaccination. (5) The farm should also implement a regular deworming program for internal and external parasites, and perform regular fecal microscopic examinations to monitor the health of the sheep. (6) If an animal owner or manager discovers or suspects an animal-borne disease or has died of an unexplained disease, they should report it to the animal quarantine agency to strengthen quarantine measures and prevent the spread of the disease.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is caused by the RNA virus Picornaviridae and is a serious infectious disease that primarily infects even-toed ungulates, including pigs, cattle, sheep, and goats. The FMD virus is divided into seven serotypes: O, A, C, Asia1, SAT-1, SAT-2, and SAT-3. Each serotype is further divided into numerous subtypes. For example, in Taiwan, the FMD virus isolated from pigs in 1997 was O/Taiwan/97, while the virus isolated from cattle infected in Kinmen and Taiwan in 1999 was O/Taiwan/99. The antigenicity of these seven serotypes differs significantly, resulting in poor cross-protection between FMD vaccines against different serotypes. The foot-and-mouth disease virus can spread rapidly, including through wind (vector) spread, through contact with animals and their products, through contact with clothing on people and through contact with animals' equipment. In addition, the disease can also be transmitted through vehicles and equipment carrying people or animals.

Symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease: The incubation period for sheep and goats infected with foot-and-mouth disease is approximately 2-7 days. Initial symptoms include a high fever (40-41 °C ) , poor spirits, loss of appetite, and excessive salivation. The tongue, lips, and gums of infected sheep become congested and develop small grayish-white spots . These spots then form blisters , which mature and rupture. Along with the oral lesions , blisters also form on the skin around the coronary arteries and between the toes. When these blisters rupture , secondary bacterial infection can cause the hoof to fall off, leaving the sheep lame or even unable to stand. The mortality rate for adult sheep infected with foot-and-mouth disease is not high (2%), but it can reach 50% for lambs. Surviving sheep typically regain their spirits and appetite within a week , and blisters, if not infected by bacteria, resolve in 1-3 weeks.

Foot-and-mouth disease prevention: Preventing foot-and-mouth disease primarily relies on strengthening epidemic reporting practices: Immediately notify veterinarians and local livestock quarantine agencies if any animals display symptoms suggestive of foot-and-mouth disease, enabling rapid control or eradication of the disease. Ranches should also strengthen their self-defense and epidemic prevention mechanisms, including enhanced disinfection of areas around livestock sheds and control of personnel and vehicle access. Furthermore, Taiwan, surrounded by the sea, previously enjoyed significant advantages in disease prevention. However, rampant smuggling has created significant loopholes in animal disease prevention. Therefore, it is imperative to foster a national awareness of epidemic prevention to prevent the influx of diseases from abroad. All citizens should heed the lessons of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and refrain from engaging in illegal smuggling, transportation, and trafficking. Citizens must also cooperate by not importing meat or other quarantined items by mail or courier to prevent the recurrence of foot-and-mouth disease.

Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a viral disease that primarily infects goats and sheep, also known as goat plague. The pathogen belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family, genus Morbillivirus. Goats are generally more susceptible than sheep, and clinical symptoms are more severe. Susceptibility varies between goat breeds and individuals within the same breed, with European goats being more susceptible. The disease occasionally occurs in other wild animals, such as deer. This disease is a Category A infectious disease. If a person is found to be infected, suspected to be infected, or potentially infected, they should be treated according to the regulations of the competent animal health authorities regarding Category A infectious diseases. This disease primarily affects goats and is not a zoonosis, posing no public health concern. China first reported cases of PPR in 2007, and in recent years (2014 and 2015) outbreaks have spread throughout mainland China, even to coastal areas such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui.

Symptoms of Peste des Petits Ruminants: During the acute phase, infected animals excrete the virus through secretions, excretions, and exhaled breath, becoming a source of infection. Infection is primarily transmitted through direct contact or short-range droplet transmission between animals in the same area through coughing. The virus is found in semen and embryos, making it potentially transmitted through artificial insemination or embryo transfer. It can also be transmitted through breast milk. The virus primarily attacks lymphoid tissue and epithelial tissues of the digestive tract. Symptoms include high fever, increased eye and nasal discharge, salivation, necrotizing stomatitis, gastroenteritis, and bronchopneumonia. The incubation period is generally 3-6 days. Clinical signs include sudden onset of high fever, reaching 40-42°C on the second or third day, with death occurring in the later stages of the fever. With the onset of fever, animals develop a decreased appetite and a depressed demeanor. Nasal discharge changes from watery to catarrhal, and nasal mucosal necrosis occurs. Animals may also develop conjunctivitis and increased eye discharge. Secondary bacterial pneumonia, cough, rales, and abdominal breathing are often associated. Within four days of the onset of fever, the oral mucosa initially develops mild hyperemia and surface erosions, accompanied by drooling. Small areas of necrosis typically begin in the mucosa beneath the gums and then rapidly spread to the gums, hard palate, cheeks, oral papillae, and tongue. Necrotic tissue sloughs, leaving irregular, shallow erosions. Some sheep experience mild oral lesions that resolve within two days. Following the onset of oral lesions, most animals develop severe diarrhea with bloody, watery stools, rapid dehydration, and weight loss. Pregnant sheep may miscarry. The infection rate and mortality rate in young sheep can reach 100%. Hyperacute cases may be free of lesions, presenting only with fever and death. Pathological changes in acute cases include necrotic lesions in the mouth and nose; hyperemia in the ileal and cecal valves; linear hyperemia and black lines (zebra striping) in the folds of the cecum, proximal colon, and rectum; splenomegaly and necrosis; and lymphadenopathy, particularly in the mesenteric lymph nodes.

Prevention of Peste des Petits Ruminants: This disease is a Category A animal infectious disease. Once introduced, prevention measures include culling and compensation. Quarantine efforts should focus on preventing the spread of the disease, with strict quarantine measures implemented for animals and animal products from infected areas (particularly mainland China). For the safety and development of Taiwan's livestock industry, ranches must implement self-prevention measures such as access control, entry and exit controls, and disinfection of livestock farms. Suspected cases should be reported immediately to the local animal quarantine authorities. Avoid visiting or interacting with animals at livestock farms in mainland China or other affected countries. Upon return, change clothing, shower, and thoroughly disinfect, and wait one week before re-entering animal farms to ensure the health and safety of the animals.

Goatpox: The Capripox virus, belonging to the Poxviridae family and the Capripoxvirus genus, is acid-labile and resistant to drying. Literature reports indicate that the virus can survive in dandruff and scabs for at least three months, and may persist in dried, crusted dandruff for several years. Goatpox virus can be transmitted through the respiratory system but can also enter the body through abrasions of the skin. Most animals become infected through close contact with infected goats. The virus can be present in all endocrine and exocrine secretions, skin lesions, and scabs. Dust and scabs containing the virus can also transmit the disease. The virus can also be transmitted mechanically through contaminated materials or insect bites, but no chronic carriers have been found to date.

Symptoms of Sheep Pox: The incubation period for artificial infection is 2-3 days , while for natural infection it is 1-3 weeks. The mortality rate in lambs is high , peaking around 2 weeks after the onset of systemic lesions . Even on sheep farms with no history of the disease , an outbreak can lead to high mortality rates. The first clinical sign of infection is fever , often accompanied by depression and loss of appetite . Conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and lymphadenitis may then develop. About 2 days later, a red rash may appear on sparsely furred areas, such as the armpits, udders, eyelids, lips, nostrils, labia, scrotum, and groin . Lesions may also appear on the skin or penetrate into muscle tissue. The rash gradually develops into raised papules and blisters , which eventually rupture or shrink and heal with scabs . Sometimes, ruptured blisters can lead to secondary bacterial infection . Recovery from the onset of symptoms takes approximately 20-40 days. Malignant sheep pox often develops on the hairless skin, respiratory mucosa (causing respiratory distress), and oral cavity (reducing feeding desire) of both lambs and adult sheep. Severe mucosal lesions often lead to necrosis and purulent oral and nasal discharge. In severe cases, animals can die before skin lesions develop. The rash-like skin lesions can sometimes lead to secondary infection at any stage of infection, causing fever and sepsis, with a mortality rate of 50-80%. Benign sheep pox, more common in adult sheep, involves milder skin lesions, sometimes confined to the ears or tail, and a mortality rate of approximately 5-10%.

Goat pox prevention: Currently, all goats in Taiwan are required to be vaccinated to control goat pox. Goat pox is currently a Class A zoonotic infectious disease. Suspected cases must be reported to local epidemic prevention authorities, who will conduct an inspection and collect samples for testing. Animals must be prevented from moving. Any animals found to be infected with goat pox must be culled to prevent the spread of the disease. After clearing the infected area, thoroughly disinfect it with an effective disinfectant such as sodium hypochlorite. Animals in surrounding pastures must undergo further sampling, testing, and monitoring.

Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis: Caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) is a viral disease that occurs commonly in advanced goat-raising countries worldwide. Surveys show an average positive rate of over 75% in Taiwan, indicating widespread transmission of the disease. CAE is primarily transmitted through lambs consuming colostrum or milk from infected ewes. The risk of transmission is particularly high when colostrum or milk from multiple ewes is mixed and fed to lambs. Horizontal transmission of CAE between flocks can also occur. Mixing CAE antibody-negative and -positive sheep can easily become infected through direct contact, feed troughs, drinking water, or through contaminated needles used in continuous injections. The virus has also been confirmed to be present in the semen and reproductive tissues of naturally infected CAE rams, making it possible for CAE to be transmitted to ewes through mating. Furthermore, studies have shown that the CAE virus is present in the ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes of goats, suggesting the disease can be vertically transmitted to embryos or lambs, or through embryo transfer.

Symptoms of Caprine Arthritis and Encephalitis: Approximately 20% of sheep infected with CAE virus will display clinical symptoms during their lifetime. The most common is polysynovitis-arthritis, which occurs primarily in adults but can also occur in sheep as young as 6 months of age. Once clinical synovitis-arthritis develops, joint swelling and lameness occur, with the wrist joint being the most common site of infection. The lesions may also be latent and asymptomatic. Encephalomyelitis can occur in lambs aged 2-4 months, but can also occur in older lambs or adults. Initial symptoms in infected lambs include weakness, ataxia, and hind limb weakness. Hyperreflexia or dyspnea are also common in CAE-infected lambs. Over time, symptoms may progress to paraparesis, tetraparesis, and paralysis. Other neurological symptoms include depression, head tilt, cyclotorsion, opisthotonos, torticollis, and water-skiing movements. Interstitial pneumonia associated with CAE infection is more common in adult sheep and less common in lambs. Ewes may experience a "hard udder" syndrome, characterized by a firm, swollen udder and an inability to produce milk after parturition. Sometimes, the udder tissue is softer and the milk is normal, but milk production is low in ewes with persistent CAE mastitis.

Prevention of Caprine Arthritis and Encephalitis: There is currently no effective treatment for CAE virus infection , but supportive care may be helpful for individual animals. Several measures can improve symptoms of polybursitis - arthritis in sheep , including regular hoof trimming, thicker bedding , and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Sheep with encephalomyelitis require several weeks of intensive care , while bacterial infections secondary to interstitial pneumonia or sclerosing mastitis can be controlled with antibiotics. Providing a high-quality, easily digestible diet can delay the onset of the wasting symptoms of the disease. Establishing a CAE- free farm is currently the only way to prevent the disease. Since the disease is primarily transmitted from ewes to lambs through lactation, strict isolation of postpartum lambs to prevent them from consuming colostrum and milk from infected ewes, thus cutting off the transmission route, combined with culling of infected lambs, can effectively reduce the prevalence of CAE on a farm, and even eliminate the disease.

Precautions for goat arthritis encephalitis prevention: The following four points should be noted when planning the prevention: (1) Serological monitoring: Serological examinations should be carried out on all sheep in the flock, and the serum-positive and serum-negative sheep should be immediately separated; if the proportion of serum antibody-positive sheep in the flock is not high, all positive sheep can be considered for elimination. Serological examinations are usually repeated every 6 months to screen out antibody-positive sheep. (2) Reduce internal infection: Because CAE is still horizontally contagious, some studies have shown that if negative sheep are in close contact with positive sheep, they will have a higher rate of turning positive after several months to years. Therefore, sheep with clinical symptoms should be eliminated immediately regardless of the situation. (3) Block the transmission route of CAE: If the proportion of antibody-positive sheep in the flock is too high after serological examination, it is necessary to squeeze out as much colostrum as possible from ewes that have two negative serological examinations during the birthing season, freeze them in small packages and store them for future use. When an antibody-positive ewe gives birth , the lamb should be removed immediately to prevent it from consuming colostrum . Instead , the lamb should be fed thawed colostrum from a negative ewe. Thawing colostrum involves placing frozen colostrum in plastic bags , unsealed , in warm water at 37-40 °C. If colostrum from an antibody-negative ewe is insufficient , colostrum from an antibody - positive ewe can be expressed and sterilized at 56 °C for one hour before feeding to the lamb. (4) Improve the feeding environment and management measures: Lambs should be fed in a well-ventilated isolation house until they are weaned at 3 months of age . It is not easy for ewes to give birth , and there is also the trouble of giving birth at night. Therefore, estrus synchronization can be used for simultaneous breeding, and prostaglandins can be injected intramuscularly on the 145th day of pregnancy to induce delivery . The ewe will give birth within about 48-72 hours after the injection. After the ewe gives birth, the lambs should be taken away immediately for feeding separately. This should help to implement the isolation of ewes and lambs and effectively control the spread of CAE in the farm.

Contagious Pustular Dermatitis (Orf): This disease, caused by a parapoxvirus, typically occurs between April and September, causing pustules on the skin of sheep and wild ruminants. In severe cases, it can lead to death, causing significant economic losses to sheep farmers. Orf is a zoonotic disease. In humans, it is typically characterized by a solitary lesion on the hands, arms, or face. The lesion initially appears as a maculopapular rash or pustule, then progresses to a rapidly proliferating nodule with an umbilical central depression. The disease primarily affects goats and sheep, affecting all breeds and sexes, but is most susceptible in lambs. It often occurs in clusters, with an incidence rate exceeding 50%. Adult sheep can also develop Orf , but the incidence is lower , with sporadic cases and milder symptoms. Sick sheep and infected sheep are the main sources of infection of this disease . The virus can exist in the pustules and scabs of sick sheep , and is mainly transmitted through trauma to the skin and mucous membranes ; contaminated feed, drinking water or scabs of sick sheep remaining on the ground can spread the disease.

Symptoms of contagious purulent stomatitis in sheep: The incubation period is 4-7 days . Initially, scattered small red spots appear on the skin and mucous membranes of the lips . These quickly develop into sesame-sized nodules , which then become blisters or pustules . These rupture and form yellow or brown, warty scabs. The scabs gradually enlarge, thicken, and dry , shedding and healing after 1-2 weeks. In severe cases, the lesions may spread to the cheeks , developing papules, blisters, pustules, and scabs. Granulation tissue proliferates beneath the scabs , causing the lips to swell and protrude outward , forming mulberry-like protrusions . This severely limits the sheep's ability to feed , leading to gradual emaciation, weakness , and even death. The illness can last up to 2-4 weeks. The sheep's body temperature rises to 4142 °C , and they lose their appetite . In severe cases , their appetite is completely lost . The illness is prolonged , with a mortality rate of approximately 10% . This disease may cause pustular lesions in other areas of the lamb where there is less hair, such as the eyelids, inside the ears, on the ventral side of the tail base, in the udder, in the esophagus, and in the rumen. Therefore, it is important to distinguish it from other diseases such as sheep pox, bluetongue, foot-and-mouth disease, and peste des petits ruminants.

Prevention of Sheep Contact Suppurative Stomatitis: Mild cases require no treatment and resolve in approximately 1-2 weeks. Severe cases require systemic medications in addition to topical oral medications, primarily to reduce inflammation and prevent secondary infection. Because there is no vaccine for this disease in Taiwan, special attention is paid to preventing secondary bacterial infection of the wound. This can be achieved by applying or spraying 1% betadine solution or antibiotics. The wound will scab and heal after 4-5 days, and healing is generally good. The mortality rate in lambs is high, so special attention should be paid to preventing starvation and malnutrition caused by insufficient milk intake. Bottle feeding and intravenous glucose and other nutrients may be necessary if necessary. Vaccination is commonly used for prevention abroad. Antibodies develop approximately 2 weeks after vaccination, and the effective antibodies last for at least 6 months. However, no vaccine is currently available in Taiwan. Other preventative measures include reducing transportation stress, frequently isolating and observing animals before adding them to the flock, isolating and treating affected sheep during outbreaks, and feeding healthy sheep first before treating or feeding affected ones. On-site staff should also be especially vigilant and wear gloves when handling affected animals. Since the disease is zoonotic, gloves and other materials that come into contact with affected areas must be cremated. Also, be careful not to consume milk from sheep with udder or nipple lesions to avoid infection.

Scrapie (Spongiform Encephalopathy): Scrapie was first discovered in sheep in England in 1730 and was prevalent in Central Europe at the time. Affected sheep experience itching and may rub against walls, tree trunks, or fences. Affected sheep can exhibit unsteady gait, tremors, blindness, falls, and ultimately death. The causative agent of scrapie is a protein-only particle containing no nucleic acid, called a prion. Prions that infect cattle were later found to cause variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. It is currently known that this denatured prion protein causes the normal prion protein in animal neural tissue to change its structure, becoming abnormal and pathogenic. It gradually accumulates within the nervous tissue, causing nerve cell degeneration and necrosis. Because nerve cells cannot regenerate after death, microscopic examination of brain tissue sections reveals cavitation and a sponge-like pathological change. Clinically, animals present with a chronic, progressive, and fatal disease. Radiation, ionization, ultraviolet light, and microwaves are ineffective in killing prions. Even after dry-heat treatment at 360°C for one hour, a small portion of prions remains infectious.

Symptoms of scrapie in sheep: This disease has a long incubation period, with natural infection lasting approximately 1-4 years. Clinical symptoms typically appear in sheep between 2 and 5 years of age. In the early stages of infection, sheep will repeatedly scratch against rocks, trees, or fences, leading to hair loss and restlessness, especially when exposed to sudden noise or movement. Some infected sheep will raise their heads or make gnawing motions if their backs are scratched. Clinical symptoms include tremors in the head and neck muscles, ataxia, staring, and dry, brittle wool. In the later stages of infection, affected sheep experience paralysis, particularly in their hind legs, eventually becoming unable to stand and becoming emaciated. Death typically occurs within 6 months of the onset of symptoms.

Prevention of scrapie in sheep: Currently, there is no vaccine or effective medication for scrapie in sheep. Therefore, countries around the world have implemented a number of preventative measures to prevent and control the disease, including enhanced disease surveillance, culling of infected animals, and prohibiting the use of high-risk animals as feed ingredients. Prions are quite resistant to traditional disinfection methods . High-pressure steam sterilization (steam autoclave) at temperatures above 132°C for at least one hour can effectively eliminate the pathogenicity of prions. Alternatively, disinfectants such as 5% sodium hypochlorite solution or 2.5N NaOH solution can partially kill prions. On the preventative side, the European Union passed legislation banning the use of animal feed products for herbivores starting January 1, 2001, to prevent animals from contracting spongiform encephalopathy and subsequently entering the human food chain, causing harm. In 1997, both the United States and Taiwan enacted legislation prohibiting the import of animals from epidemic-affected areas (including cattle and sheep) and their products (meat and bone meal, meat meal, bone meal, poultry meal, blood meal, animal feed fats, animal feed oil residue, cattle and sheep embryos, serum, etc.). The import of beef, beef products, beef offal, and other bovine raw materials for human consumption from epidemic-affected areas that fail risk assessments is also prohibited, and the re-export of products from epidemic-affected areas through non-epidemic areas is prevented.

Caseous lymphadenitis is a common disease in goats. It involves one to several abscesses of varying sizes in or near the surface lymph nodes of the goat. This disease can cause cosmetic and health problems for the goat and can lead to significant economic losses for the ranch. This disease, also known as pseudotuberculosis, is mostly caused by the Gram-positive bacillus Corynebacterium rubrum tussotuberculosis. This facultative anaerobic bacterium can survive in the environment for months. It can invade through epidermal wounds and be carried to the lymph nodes by phagocytes or spread through the bloodstream to the systemic lymphatic system, causing abscesses to form in or on the surface of the goat's lymph nodes. Most livestock owners, once the lesions mature, use a scalpel to incise the swelling to drain the abscesses. While this may reduce the swelling, it often leads to the development of new abscesses elsewhere. The disease can be transmitted through ingestion of food contaminated with Corynebacterium, traumatic infection, bites of blood-sucking insects, or transmission through external parasites.

Symptoms of caseous lymphadenitis: This disease is common in the lymph nodes or their vicinity near the ears, neck, front of the shoulder, flanks, and hind legs. In addition to the abscess lesions visible on the body surface, this disease often invades the lymph nodes of the lungs and mesentery and other internal organs. Although the abscess can be seen to be 3-5 cm in size, the sheep do not show obvious systemic symptoms such as fever or decreased appetite. Clinically, deep abscesses in the neck can sometimes be seen compressing and hindering the sick sheep's feeding and rumination. If the abscess lumps appear on the face, causing facial nerve paralysis, or if the salivary glands are compressed, the sheep will experience frequent drooling. Severe pulmonary and mediastinal lymph node abscesses may cause sheep to suffer from chronic coughing and abdominal breathing. According to survey reports, the mortality rate of adult sheep can reach 20%. Sheep with visceral disease will experience growth stagnation and gradually lose weight. The visceral type is also called pseudotuberculosis.

Prevention of Caseous Lymphadenitis: Lymph node abscesses caused by this disease are treated surgically by incision, removing as much pus as possible , and irrigating with betadine solution (0.5% available iodine) 3-5 times until the iodine solution returns to its original color. This treatment may require continuous treatment for 2-3 days. Deep neck abscesses are sometimes located in close proximity to major blood vessels, the trachea, and the esophagus. Therefore, for safety reasons, it is best to have a veterinarian sedate or anesthetize the sheep before surgical removal. For more effective treatment of lymph node abscesses, in addition to surgical treatment, intramuscular injections of penicillin or cephalosporin are also necessary for 3-5 days to prevent recurrence. Because sheep are active and like to rub against railings, their skin becomes rough and cracked, leading to trauma. The disease is primarily transmitted through wounds. Therefore, sharp objects must be removed from the sheep pen, old, rusted, and cracked metal railings must be replaced, and the sheep pen must be kept clean and hygienic. A regular disinfection program must be implemented to reduce the spread of the disease. General disinfectants or hot water with a temperature above 60°C can kill this bacteria.

Tuberculosis: This disease is a major zoonosis caused by infection with Mycobacterium spp. bacteria. The primary pathogen is Mycobacterium bovis, but it can also be caused by M. tuberculosis, M. avium, and other so-called atypical mycobacteria. In Taiwan, tuberculosis in dairy sheep is a notifiable livestock disease, and a "test and cull" policy is implemented. The test method is the intradermal tuberculin test (ITT). Following intradermal injection, the test is performed by inspection and palpation 72 hours after injection (within the first and last 6 hours). Any swelling at the injection site is considered positive. The primary route of infection is the respiratory tract (droplet infection), followed by the digestive tract through contaminated milk, feces, urine, feed, and drinking water.

Symptoms of Tuberculosis: Although severely infected sheep may only exhibit symptoms such as coughing, swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, diarrhea, emaciation, and decreased milk production, due to current regular inspection and culling policies, infected animals are generally culled when they are mildly ill and have no clinical symptoms. Symptoms of tuberculosis in sheep vary depending on the location and number of tuberculous nodules. Lung infections may present with pneumonia-like symptoms such as a persistent dry cough and difficulty breathing, especially with temperature fluctuations or tracheal compression. Digestive tract infections may cause intermittent diarrhea or constipation. Uterine infections may produce purulent, cheesy, and bloody discharge. Central nervous system infections may cause partial paralysis, hyperesthesia, and motor disorders such as cyclotorsion. Uterine infections may result in nodular, localized, or diffuse swelling, as well as enlarged upper mammary lymph nodes. Nursing lambs can become infected within hours or days of birth through suckling. The basic lesion of this disease is a granuloma (tuberculosis nodule), ranging in size from a small spot to several tens of centimeters in diameter. The center is yellowish-white or white, with some having a cheesy or cottage cheese-like texture. Occasionally, it may feel calcified when cut. It is often surrounded by a yellowish-white connective tissue capsule. As the nodule grows, it often ruptures, releasing a cheesy fluid.

Tuberculosis Prevention: Tuberculosis is a zoonotic disease. According to Article 13 of the Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases in Animals, sheep over three months of age on farms must undergo annual testing. Sheep that test positive for tuberculosis are incurable and must be immediately isolated, milking prohibited, and culled as soon as possible in accordance with regulations. Compensation of up to three-fifths of the assessed value of the animals will be paid (this culling compensation will be handled by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine and the respective counties and cities in accordance with existing regulations). All contaminated pastures with tuberculosis-positive cases should undergo enhanced testing, with retests every three months. Regular testing can resume after three consecutive retests and when all sheep are negative. Because tuberculosis bacteria are more resilient than other microorganisms, they can survive for over three months in grazing pastures, 160 days in sheep pens, and 160-293 days in untreated manure. It is recommended that sheep farms where tuberculosis has occurred, in addition to routine tuberculin testing and culling of positive infected sheep, should wash the sheep houses and utensils with clean water several times, rinse them with hot soapy water once, and then disinfect them with an effective disinfectant.

Pregnancy toxemia: Pregnancy toxemia is a metabolic disease that occurs in ewes during late pregnancy. Each fetus requires approximately 30 to 40 grams of glucose per day for metabolism. Rapid growth requires a high energy supply. If the ewe's supply is insufficient, the body will rely on fat metabolism to generate energy for the lambs in utero, resulting in insufficient energy. Research data shows that elderly, obese, and multi-fetal ewes are more susceptible to pregnancy toxemia. This energy conversion and metabolism occurs in the ewe's liver, resulting in hepatic lipidosis or fatty liver, ultimately leading to liver dysfunction. Excessive fat metabolism also produces highly toxic products, such as ketone bodies, which are released into the bloodstream and throughout the body.

Symptoms of pregnancy toxemia: Pregnancy toxemia typically occurs one to three weeks before delivery and can result in the death of the ewe. Symptoms include mild to severe loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, slowed movements, and ataxia, often leading to difficulty standing and consequently lying down. Affected sheep may also exhibit neurological symptoms, such as teeth grinding or vision loss. Affected sheep may become comatose within hours to two days of the onset of these symptoms, ultimately dying from impaired liver and kidney function. Of course, the fetus will also die if the ewe dies. Furthermore, if the fetus dies first, it can lead to sepsis in the ewe if not removed urgently.

Prevention of Pregnancy Toxemia: Effective treatment of pregnancy toxemia requires early diagnosis and treatment at the earliest stages. Medications include propylene glycol (60-90 ml) administered orally 2-3 times daily. Oral electrolytes or intravenous Ringer's lactate can also be helpful. If the ewe has already reached the lethargic stage , treatment is often expensive, uneconomical, and has a poor prognosis.

Precautions for Pregnancy Toxemia Prevention: For prevention, special attention should be paid to the husbandry and management of ewes in late pregnancy. Important tasks include: 1. Drying off. Pregnant ewes should have a 40-60 day dry period to allow the body weight lost during lactation to gradually increase and the udders to rest adequately in preparation for the next lactation. During the dry period, an antibiotic ointment used for dry cows can be applied at the same dosage as for cows, instilled into both stalls. This dry period treatment is crucial, even if the udders are healthy in late lactation, as many new udder infections occur in the first few weeks of the dry period. Furthermore, if a multiparous flock has a high incidence of mastitis after parturition, it is recommended that the ewes be given appropriate teat dips during the first one or two weeks of the dry period, even if they are not milking during this period, until milk production ceases and the udders begin to shrink. 2. During the last six weeks of pregnancy, the growth and development of lambs in utero increases significantly compared to the early stages. During this period, the ewe's dry matter intake decreases slightly, exacerbating energy depletion. Fat tissue begins to metabolize in response to the energy deficit, leading to pregnancy toxemia. To prevent metabolic diseases, especially pregnancy toxemia, during this period, it is crucial to provide the ewe with high-quality forage that meets her nutritional needs during the early dry period to ensure proper rumen function. Two to three weeks before farrowing, the ewe's metabolic needs change dramatically. Therefore, in addition to high-quality forage, it is essential to provide her with more energy in the form of concentrates, such as corn. It is also important to note that female lambs still require a higher-nutrient and energy-rich diet to maintain growth during the final stages of pregnancy. Female lambs should not be housed in the same pen as dry ewes to prevent aggression, which could harm the female lambs' health and lead to miscarriage.

Mastitis: Mastitis is defined as an inflammatory reaction of the mammary gland, typically resulting in characteristic changes in the properties, composition, and bacteriological characteristics of the milk secreted. Once mastitis occurs, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent severe and irreversible tissue damage and loss of milk production. Pathogenic bacteria are the most common cause of mastitis in goats. These pathogens initially colonize the streak canal before entering the mammary gland, causing infection. Improper milking technique and poor hygiene increase the risk of infection.

Symptoms of Mastitis: The most important pathogen on pastures is Staphylococcus aureus, which causes symptoms ranging from acute to subclinical. In severe cases, the udder may become gangrenous, with a bluish-purple appearance and no warmth to the touch. The milk may become watery and dark red due to the presence of blood. Other less commonly isolated bacteria include Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and Mycoplasma spp. The systemic symptoms of acute mastitis caused by E. coli vary greatly in severity , ranging from mild cases with only localized inflammation of the mammary tissue to severe cases with significant systemic symptoms, including rumen hypomotility, dehydration, shock, and even death. The infected udder will have a watery, serous discharge, and the body temperature may reach 40°C or higher. Within a few hours to a day of infection, the infected udder will become edematous, swollen, and sensitive to the touch, and a serum-like fluid will be secreted.

Mastitis Prevention: The most effective way to control Staphylococcus aureus mastitis is to strictly follow correct milking procedures and maintain good milking hygiene. In particular, teat dipping ewes with an effective antiseptic immediately after milking reduces or eliminates pathogen transmission during milking, minimizes pathogen contamination of the ewe's teat ducts, and prevents new infections. Additionally, certain nutrients, such as dietary supplementation with appropriate amounts of vitamin E, selenium, vitamin A, and beta-carotene, can enhance an animal's resistance to mastitis. Treatment of clinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis is often ineffective, with frequent recurrences and a high risk of infection in healthy sheep. Milk sampling and microbial culture can be performed on individual pens throughout the herd to identify subclinical mastitis, which is infection but not yet clinically evident. These cases can be treated with an effective antibiotic ointment instilled into the udder. Most E. coli infections require specialized veterinary treatment, including antibiotics, intravenous hypertonic saline, antiprostaglandins, steroids, antihistamines, and calcium therapy. Important steps in treating E. coli infections include frequent milking of infected sheep to remove white blood cells, bacteria, and toxins from the mammary glands. Regular milking every few hours is particularly effective. Injecting oxytocin at the end of milking can also help eliminate residual milk containing toxins. Good environmental and milking hygiene can effectively control E. coli mastitis. Teats must be cleaned and dried before milking. Pre-milking dips can prevent environmental mastitis caused by Streptococci and E. coli. Pre-milking dips require sufficient time for the disinfectant to kill bacteria, typically about 20-30 seconds. Afterward, wipe the solution off with a clean paper towel to prevent it from entering the milking equipment and remaining in the milk. Sometimes, teats are dipped before milking without being cleaned. This often prevents the disinfectant from reaching the bacteria due to feces and dirt on the teats, thus failing to reduce mastitis and somatic cell counts, resulting in reduced milk quality. In addition, the vacuum low pressure of the milking machine should not fluctuate too much, and the milk cup rubber must be replaced regularly to prevent E. coli from invading the breast.

Q Fever: Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. It has become a major cause of abortions, particularly in sheep farms, resulting in significant economic losses. Coxiella burnetii can be transmitted to a wide range of domestic and wild animals, including horses, dogs, rabbits, deer, and even reptiles, birds, and arthropods, through the air, contact with infected animal feces, and the bites of various tick species. Sheep, cattle, and goats are the primary sources of Q fever in humans.

Q fever: In animals, Q fever infection typically presents with no clinical symptoms or nonspecific symptoms such as fever, anorexia, and shortness of breath . However, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, hepatitis, and reproductive failure may also occur. During late pregnancy , Q fever can reactivate, resulting in a latent infection , resulting in high concentrations of the pathogen in the amniotic fluid and placenta. The main symptoms of Q fever in sheep are stillbirth, premature birth, weak fetuses, and placental infection . While aborted fetuses may appear normal , aborted placentas may show intercotyledonary fibrosis and turbid exudate . Severe inflammation may occur in the myometrium and adjacent stroma . In cattle, metritis and recurrent infertility are the main symptoms. Q fever infection in sheep may occasionally present with bronchopneumonia and pink eye , but these symptoms are generally mild or absent. The pathogen has a high affinity for the udder and placenta, and after reactivation in the placenta, it rapidly multiplies, easily causing miscarriage or stillbirth in infected ewes. The placenta or amniotic fluid of these pregnant animals becomes a significant source of infection. Infected animals can transmit the pathogen through urine, feces, milk, or birth materials (particularly the placenta). Animals infected with Q fever can excrete the bacteria through multiple pathways. Reports indicate that sheep primarily shed the bacteria through the reproductive tract and feces, while cattle primarily shed the bacteria through milk and the reproductive tract. Due to the high tolerance of Q fever bacteria in the environment, continuous excretion, latent reinfection during pregnancy, and the lack of clinical symptoms following infection, the pathogen persists and is difficult to eliminate.

Q fever prevention: This disease is a zoonosis. To minimize contamination of animals and the environment, special precautions must be taken during on-site prevention and control: 1. Exercise extreme caution when importing new animals to farms not infected with Q fever. Farms should regularly monitor animals for antibody testing. Farms with positive serological results should only export animals to Q fever-positive farms. 2. During the farrowing and late pregnancy periods, when the disease is most prevalent, it is best to separate pregnant ewes from the farrowing area. 3. After farrowing or abortion, fetal and placental tissue must be removed by farm personnel wearing protective clothing such as gloves, masks, and respirators. These products must be promptly buried or incinerated to prevent contact and ingestion by domestic animals or wild animals, which could cause contamination. 4. In addition to the reproductive tract, this pathogen can be excreted through feces. Therefore, proper composting and bedding treatment is crucial. Lime or 0.4% calcium cyanamide should be mixed in and covered. 5. For environmental disinfection, 1:100 diluted bleach (containing 5.25% effective hypochlorite), 5% H2O2, or 1:100 diluted Lysol (a mixture of saponified alkyl aromatic carbolic acid) can be used for disinfection. However, alcohol, 1% carbolic acid, 1% formalin, and quaternary amine compounds are not effective against Q fever pathogens.

Chlamydiosis: Chlamydia is an infection caused by an intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium and a significant zoonotic disease in pastures. Currently, 11 species of Chlamydophila have been classified, with Chlamydophila pecorum and C. abortus ( Chlamydophila abortus ) being common in cattle and sheep. Serological surveys in various countries have shown antibody prevalence rates ranging from 45% to 100%, indicating that Chlamydophila is now widespread in pastures and has become an enzootic pathogen. Chlamydophila can cause abortions and carry high levels of the pathogen in fetuses and placentas. Chlamydophila can also be spread through other secretions (such as vaginal, ocular, and nasal secretions, semen, urine, etc.) and feces, contaminating the environment. Other animals may ingest or inhale the pathogen, potentially causing infection. Furthermore, infected bulls can transmit the pathogen to cows during natural mating.

Symptoms of Chlamydia: Infected sheep often show no clinical symptoms, but may experience reproductive problems such as miscarriage, endometritis, vaginitis, and repeated infertility. A few may develop other organ problems, including pneumonia, arthritis, enteritis, hepatitis, encephalomyelitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and mastitis. Recent studies have also shown that in addition to causing these reproductive problems, chlamydia may also affect milk production, shorten the lifespan, cause premature delivery, reduce the survival rate of lambs, and affect the growth and development of lambs. Explosive abortion in ewes, also known as endemic abortion in sheep, specifically refers to a large-scale abortion outbreak in late pregnancy caused by Chlamydia abortus (C. abortus).

Chlamydia prevention: Some literature recommends administering long-acting oxytetracycline subcutaneously twice weekly to pregnant ewes until the last month of pregnancy to prevent miscarriage. However, it is important to note that while medication can slow the onset of miscarriage, it may not completely eliminate the bacteria or reduce the likelihood of bacterial excretion. Additionally, farmhands can reduce the spread of the pathogen by isolating aborted animals and removing aborted fetuses and placentas from the barn to prevent ingestion and infection by other animals. Chlamydia is resistant to dry cold but unstable to heat, becoming inactive after 10 minutes at 60°C. Maintaining clean barns, sheep beds, walkways, and animal surfaces is crucial for farms free of chlamydia infection. Reducing the number of sheep purchased from outside and providing separate farrowing pens are also important factors in reducing chlamydia infection. After ewes give birth, the farrowing pens should be disinfected with a disinfectant such as a quaternary amine disinfectant or 1% bleach to prevent the spread of the pathogen.

Lamb pneumonia: The greatest economic loss in sheep farming is low lambing rates. This problem is caused not only by common ewe abortion but also by respiratory diseases (pneumonia). Suckling lambs often suffer from primary or secondary respiratory infections, either viral or bacterial. This is because the respiratory mucosa of young animals has greater vascular permeability, the peripharyngeal lymph nodes are underdeveloped, the bronchial glands produce less mucus, and the ciliated epithelium is less motile, resulting in weaker foreign body clearance and barrier defenses. Inadequate first milk intake, incomplete immunization, overcrowding, improper husbandry, sudden changes in weather, and cold weather can all weaken the young animal's physiological defenses, leading to the proliferation of invading respiratory pathogens and the secretion of toxins that damage respiratory tissue, causing symptoms. Pneumonia in lambs can be caused by pathogens including viruses, mycoplasmas, and bacteria . Common bacteria include Escherichia coli ( E. coli) and Pasteurella spp. E. coli is a common environmental bacterium that can be isolated from the feces of most warm-blooded animals . However, its pathogenicity varies depending on its virulence factors . In adult lambs , E. coli infection primarily causes toxemia , while in lambs, it often causes enteritis, septicemia, or toxemia . Factors such as overcrowding, insufficient colostrum intake, and a dirty environment increase the risk of oral infection with E. coli , leading to diarrhea. Affected lambs suffer from diarrhea, dehydration, and ultimately death from shock. Septicemic infections are relatively common in lambs . The pathogen may enter the bloodstream through the intestinal tract, respiratory tract, or umbilical cord. Due to the effects of endotoxins , the disease progresses rapidly and has a high mortality rate. Lambs that survive may later develop arthritis. If newborn lambs are infected with E. coli, sometimes the sick lambs do not develop diarrhea but suffer from severe pneumonia. It is speculated that the pathogen is a respiratory tract infection. This may be because the breeding environment contains a large number of pathogens, coupled with factors such as close feeding and poor ventilation. The lambs have been exposed to E. coli before eating colostrum, or the colostrum intake is insufficient. Intimate actions such as licking the lambs by ewes may also indirectly spread the pathogens, causing the lambs to inhale the pathogens, resulting in respiratory system infections, more serious pneumonia, and even fatal risks.

Symptoms of pneumonia in lambs: Respiratory symptoms in lambs and lambgirls include depression, loss of appetite, or even complete loss of appetite. Severe pneumonia can cause elevated fever, inability to stand, and coughing. Serous, mucous, or purulent discharge may be observed from the nostrils. Some lambs are unresponsive to treatment and gradually weaken and die. Those that survive tend to grow slowly and become emaciated.

Prevention of Lamb Pneumonia: Treatment is recommended with broad-spectrum antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, plus a B-complex vitamin supplement, once daily for three to five days. However, the best preventive measure is improved husbandry and care. The first 24-48 hours after birth are crucial for lambs. The umbilical cord must be tied securely and soaked in a 7% iodine solution. Colostrum is the milk produced by the ewe between 18 hours after parturition. It contains essential immunoglobulins that protect the lamb against farm-specific diseases and provides nutrition and energy. Lambs require an average of 45cc of colostrum per kilogram of body weight, meaning each lamb should receive at least 120cc of colostrum as its first feeding. Lambs typically begin to suckle on their own after their first feeding of colostrum. However, if they are still unable to suckle, they should continue to receive milk via a nasogastric tube every two to three hours. Ideally, lambs should receive their mother's colostrum, but if the ewe is unable to produce milk, colostrum from a lamb that gave birth on the same day can also be fed. Therefore, freezing and storing the remaining colostrum for emergency use is a very important on-site feeding method.

Escherichia coli in lambs: Escherichia coli is a common environmental bacterium that can be isolated from the feces of most warm-blooded animals . Its pathogenicity varies depending on its virulence factors . In lambs, E. coli infection often causes enteritis, sepsis, or toxemia. Animals generally have good resistance to E. coli . After birth, lambs obtain effective antibodies from colostrum to combat invading pathogens. However, if the ewes themselves are not properly fed and managed, resulting in insufficient nutrition and immunity, coupled with other pressing on-site conditions, the ewes in late pregnancy may not be able to produce high-quality colostrum to provide adequate immune protection for the lambs . This can allow pathogens from the environment to enter , leading to serious outbreaks.

Symptoms of E. coli infection in lambs: Clinical signs of E. coli infection in lambs generally include depression, loss of appetite, or even complete insufficiency. Severe pneumonia can result in elevated fever, inability to stand, and coughing. Serous, mucous, or purulent discharge from the nostrils may be observed. Some lambs are unresponsive to treatment and gradually weaken and die. Those that survive experience slow growth and become emaciated. E. coli isolated from sheep can be divided into two groups: enteropathogenic and septicemic. Enteropathogenic E. coli is less invasive, resident in the small intestine (jejunum) and secreting enterotoxins that can cause diarrhea in lambs. E. coli may be responsible for approximately 25% of diarrheal illnesses in lambs, sometimes as high as 75%, with a mortality rate ranging from 10% to 50%. Septicemic E. coli is highly invasive, capable of penetrating the small intestinal wall and entering other organs and tissues. Lambs infected with septicemic E. coli typically die within three to seven days of birth. Clinically, they present with severe depression and tachycardia, but no other symptoms, such as diarrhea. The bacteria circulate through the bloodstream to the brain and joints, causing meningoencephalitis. Lambs may experience recumbency, opisthotonus, colic, paddling, convulsions, nystagmus, and hypopyoncia and panophthalmitis. Surviving lambs may also exhibit arthritis, swollen joints, and lameness.

Prevention of E. coli in lambs: Treatment is recommended with broad-spectrum antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, along with a vitamin B complex. However, the best approach is to improve feeding and management, disinfect the lamb's umbilicus after birth, and provide high-quality colostrum. For prevention, special attention must be paid to the feeding and management of newborn lambs. Generally, after colostrum feeding, each lamb needs to drink 20% of its body weight in milk replacer daily for normal growth. This means that each lamb weighing approximately 4 kg needs 800cc of milk replacer daily. If fed four times daily, each meal should contain at least 200cc. If the lamb is too weak to drink colostrum, colostrum must be administered via gavage tube. Lambs that are weak or underweight at birth should only be given 10% of their body weight in colostrum daily, divided into four gavages. Other precautions include reducing chlamydia and Q fever infections in ewes, reducing the infection rate of mastitis in ewes, reducing the positive rate of caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) in the farm, and giving ewes vitamin E and selenium before delivery to improve immunity.

Coccidiosis: Coccidiosis is a common cause of diarrhea in lambs. Coccidia often cause an inapparent infection in animals, resulting in no clinical symptoms. When coccidiosis occurs and diarrhea develops in animals, it is often due to improper management, excessive sources of infection, and stressful conditions, which weaken the lamb's immune system and lead to clinical symptoms. Coccidiosis in goats is caused by Eimeria spp., which primarily infest the goat's intestinal epithelium, damaging the intestinal mucosa. This damages the intestinal epithelium, impairing digestion and absorption, and reducing the utilization of food, water, and electrolytes.

Symptoms of coccidiosis infection: Clinical symptoms include weight loss, depression, loss of appetite, soft stools, black stools, bloody diarrhea, watery diarrhea, dehydration or other secondary diseases. The age of onset is generally 1-3 months old.

Prevention of Coccidiosis: When sheep experience diarrhea, the cause should be identified immediately and laboratory tests performed to determine if the cause is coccidiosis. If diarrhea in lambs is due to coccidiosis, appropriate parasite-directed medication should be administered. In addition, intramuscular injections of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used to alleviate diarrheal symptoms. Severely ill lambs may also require oral electrolytes or intravenous fluids to replenish electrolytes and fluids. Sick lambs should be isolated to prevent transmission of coccidiosis to healthy sheep. For prevention, special attention should be paid to the immediate feeding of colostrum to lambs born to maintain their immune system. Lambs should not be purchased from farms with diarrheal illnesses. New lambs should be isolated for a period of time before being mixed with other lambs. These are all effective measures to prevent stress and reduce the risk of parasites.

Bloat: After digesting and metabolizing the feed consumed, the rumen produces large amounts of gas. Similar to other ruminants, this gas is released through the mouth as belching. If other factors prevent the belching and gas from being expelled from the rumen, the rumen will begin to distend, resulting in a noticeable swelling and bulging of the flanks. There are several reasons for sudden bloating in sheep, and on-site personnel should be aware of them. Bloat can be a serious life-threatening condition, and in severe cases, can lead to death if not treated urgently. The most common cause of bloat in sheep is overeating. Bloat can also occur in sheep that are prone to rushing for food, or when feeding time has passed and they are overly hungry because they have not eaten. Once feeding begins, they tend to rush for food, resulting in overeating and bloating. Sometimes, bloat is more common in sheep that consume large amounts of grain at once. Rapid changes in sheep's diets can also cause bloat. A stable diet maintains a balanced microbial environment in the rumen . If this balance is disrupted, ruminal gas can accumulate rapidly, leading to bloat. Lambs are also more susceptible to bloat after switching from ewe's milk to lower-quality milk substitutes (pre-mixed milk powder), especially when these substitutes are based on soy-based protein. Some milk substitutes contain high levels of processed or unprocessed crude fat, which can also contribute to bloat. In these cases, the excess fat coats the digestive tract, preventing efficient absorption of nutrients and water. Some farms have a high incidence of bloat in lambs, with mortality rates as high as 25-30%. Recent studies have shown that deficiencies in potassium and magnesium in lamb diets can contribute to bloat, especially when grazing pastures high in alfalfa. Therefore, supplementing the diet with these trace elements can help prevent bloat. Bloat in lambs aged 2 to 4 weeks may also be related to the proliferation of Clostridium perfringins type A or Sarcina spp. in the stomach. The proliferation of these bacteria metabolizes sugars in milk, producing large amounts of gas and acid. These acids kill other bacteria, while the gas accumulates in the fourth stomach.

Symptoms of bloat: The left abdomen of affected sheep rapidly swells, and the abdominal wall becomes enlarged, tense, and resilient when pushed. Rumen movements, belching, and rumination decrease significantly. Soft stools may be observed in the early stages of bloat, but may cease to be present later. Furthermore, the sheep may become restless, kicking their lower abdomen, rolling around, and unusually excited. Sometimes, they may become depressed, standing up and lying down repeatedly, and eventually become listless and unsteady. Mild cases may gradually expel gas through the mouth and anus, returning to normal after about half a day to a day. Severe cases of bloat can cause respiratory distress and circulatory problems, and without immediate and effective treatment, can lead to death within hours.

Bloat Prevention: If a sheep with bloat is still able to stand and walk , it is recommended to orally administer 120-150 ml of mineral oil ( liquid paraffin ) to massage the ventral rumen and stimulate movement to facilitate the expulsion of ruminal gas through the esophagus. Alternatively , 20-25 grams (g) of baking soda in 100 ml of warm water can be administered orally. If a sheep with bloat is unable to stand , it is recommended to call a veterinarian for immediate treatment . Excessive rumen gas accumulation can compress the lungs and heart , leading to shock. Emergency rumen puncture with a rumen trocar can effectively release rumen gas . However , trocar puncture should only be performed after all other treatments have been completed and the sheep has not yet fully recovered . The puncture can also cause gas to be released too quickly, leading to cardiopulmonary failure, and serious infection at the puncture site, resulting in peritonitis, which is life-threatening. Furthermore, when sheep experience foamy bloat, trocar puncture may not effectively release the gas. In this case, an emergency rumenectomy is necessary to completely remove the rumen contents. Then, approximately 300-500 ml of rumen fluid from healthy sheep or cattle should be infused to restore the rumen microbial environment. Sheep diets should be maintained as stable as possible. If changes are necessary, they should be made gradually, otherwise digestive problems may occur. Because deficiencies in potassium and magnesium in sheep diets can cause bloat, adding these trace elements to the diet can help prevent it . Baking soda can be placed freely in the sheep barn. It effectively balances the rumen pH, maintaining a normal rumen microbial environment, promoting digestive function, and reducing the incidence of rumen bloat. Furthermore, for sheep farms where lambs are prone to bloat, adding penicillin-like antibiotics to milk can reduce the incidence of fourth stomach bloat. In addition, it is best to feed lambs small meals frequently and feed them milk substitutes in proportion to their body weight. The feeding time should also be fixed, and try not to change the feeding amount and time to avoid bloating.


Taiwan's mutton industry experienced a rapid surge in production over the past decade , but after a sharp drop in mutton prices, it has returned to a trend of declining production each year. In 2004 , 122,533 domestic mutton were slaughtered , comparable to the 121,881 in 1994. Domestic mutton self-sufficiency rates were similar, at 9.95% in 1994 and 8.50% in 2004. Comparing various data points with current data, the production and sales figures for domestic mutton in 1994 and 2004 suggest that these figures represent the optimal marginal returns for sheep farmers. Regarding the structure of the mutton industry, on the optimistic side, production, processing, and marketing have established a satisfactory structure. However, objectively speaking, the outlook for the mutton industry is constrained by policy constraints and the large-scale import of cheap mutton from New Zealand and Australia. Consequently, the industry can only maintain a stable operation, rather than pursuing ambitious goals. If the current state of Taiwan's mutton industry in 2004 and 2005 is defined as a benchmark platform capable of stable profits, it means that over the next 10 years, the direction of Taiwan's mutton industry should be to set goals and strictly implement planned production. That is, to achieve a domestic mutton self-sufficiency rate of between 9 and 10%, a stable lamb rearing rate, and strive for zero growth in the number of sheep raised. The transaction price can be controlled by quantity to balance supply and demand, so as to avoid a recurrence of historical events in which prices collapsed due to increased production.

In November 1988, the Taiwan Provincial Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry assisted the Yunlin County Meat Market in establishing a sheep auction business. That year, 27,931 domestic sheep were slaughtered, weighing only 371 metric tons. That same year, Taiwan imported 12,375 metric tons of frozen (or chilled) mutton from Australia and other countries, resulting in a domestic mutton self-sufficiency rate of only 2.91%. In 2004, 122,533 domestic sheep were slaughtered, weighing 2,781 metric tons. Compared to 371 metric tons in 1988, the total weight of domestic sheep carcasses increased 6.5 times over the past 16 years. Imported frozen (or chilled) mutton also increased 1.4 times over the same period. Despite the significant increase in domestic mutton supply, in 2004, domestic mutton accounted for only 8.5% of the total mutton supply. The long-term dominance of imported mutton in the domestic market has directly suppressed the development of the domestic mutton industry.

From the perspective of mutton consumption, Taiwan's mutton consumption is estimated to remain between 31,000 and 35,000 metric tons in the next two to three years. The domestic mutton industry will maintain its growth rate, and the market transaction price of mutton may remain stable . However, if the mutton self-sufficiency rate continues to decline, it may lead to issues that are related to the lifeblood of the sheep farming industry, which is worthy of reflection by agricultural policy agencies and the sheep farming community.

The cost of raising domestic mutton is significantly higher than that of imported mutton, making it clear that domestic mutton cannot compete with imported mutton in terms of price. Furthermore, the domestic livestock industry has historically lacked a robust response mechanism, leading to rapid and widespread abandonment of livestock during emergencies, repeatedly causing pain in the industry. It is undeniable that the domestic mutton industry has long been underdeveloped in both its physical and organizational structure.

Before 1997, most mutton farmers raised mutton as a sideline. A sharp drop in domestic mutton prices in 1996, coupled with an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in pigs in March 1997, led to a dramatic drop in the number of mutton farmers by over 2,600 in less than two years, devastating the industry. The scale of breeding and the number of mutton sheep have declined annually since then. Comparing 1995 and 2002, mutton farms had nearly 320,000 head of sheep at the end of 1995, but by the end of 2002, only 161,858 remained, a decrease of approximately 50%. Fortunately, the dairy sheep industry provided support during this same period. Comparing the number of dairy sheep raised between 1994 and the end of 2002, the decrease was only 2.8%. Objectively speaking, in the development of Taiwan's sheep industry over the past decade, the dairy sheep industry has supported the mutton industry. This reflects the fact that, under the normal supply and marketing system of provincial goat milk transportation and marketing cooperatives, the mutton industry has been able to rely on itself, and the subsequent organization of production and marketing teams has ultimately helped to maintain its stability. By the end of 2000, the number of sheep-raising, production and marketing teams in various counties and cities had reached 56. Subsequently, sheep-raising associations at the county and city levels in Nantou County and Taichung County were established, and the organizational structure gradually became sound.

Currently, the Nubian is the dominant meat sheep breed in Taiwan, commonly known in the market as "long-eared." "Gaizai" refers to a cross between Nubians and Taiwanese goats. Nubians command auction prices ranging from NT$15 to NT$30 per kilogram higher than so-called dairy rams (such as Sanen, Albain, Toggenburg, and Lai Manjiao). Nubian goats were introduced in 1985 by the Hengchun Branch of the Council of Agriculture's Animal Products Research Institute, and selected from crosses between Nubians and Taiwanese goats at the Hualien Stock Breeding Farm. Nubians and their hybrids were introduced in 1991 and 1992, and have been a dominant breed for over a decade. They are not only a favorite of meat farmers, but also a prized commodity for sheep traders and mutton hot pot operators. The market's preference for Nubians and their hybrids is primarily due to their superior meat quality, high dressing and lean meat percentages. One-year-old Nubian castrated rams are a top choice for both the domestic mutton hot pot industry and mutton lovers. According to data from two surveys of goat breeders in Taiwan conducted by the Taiwan Sheep Breeding Association in 2000 and 2004, the Nubian herd led the way among purebred goats. In 2000, there were 44,178 purebred Nubian goats, and in 2004, there were 27,320. As for hybrid goats, there were 135,618 in 2000 and 57,561 in 2004, both of which were the highest among all breeds. This suggests that Taiwanese goat breeders are less interested in purebred goat breeding and are instead pursuing hybridization to improve meat quality, with a focus on weight gain.

Since the Yunlin County Meat Market began operating mutton auctions in late 1988 , it has established a comprehensive listing and trading system. The average annual weight of sheep auctioned in 1989 was only 32.65 kg, rising to 35.43 kg in 1990 and reaching 41.51 kg in 1992. Live weight analysis reveals the remarkable success of the imported Nubian goat breed. Between 1991 and 1995 , the Chianan Goat Milk Marketing Cooperative in Taiwan imported over 11,000 dairy goats from the United States, Australia, and New Zealand to expand its milk supply. This multi-pronged approach resulted in improved growth traits for Taiwan's black native goats, driven by hybrid vigor. From 1994 to 1998 , the Nubian goat market dominated Taiwan's mutton market, with the average annual weight of marketed goats ranging between 43 and 45 kg. By 2000, the average annual weight of marketed mutton sheep had surpassed 50 kilograms. This is thought to be related to a public hearing on "How Taiwan's Sheep Industry Can Emerge from the Shadow of WTO Accession" held by former legislator Huang Xiumeng and the Taiwan Sheep Farmers Association on May 25, 1998. The hearing took place against the backdrop of a sharp drop in mutton prices in 1996, leading to an estimated 2,000 sheep farmers abandoning their flocks. Furthermore, an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in pigs in March 1997 further posed operational challenges for the sheep industry. Furthermore, with no imported breeding sheep for over two years starting in 1997, the demand for breeding rams was acute. One of the conclusions of the public hearing was: "It is recommended that the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, approve a trial import of 200 breeding rams." This was a timely improvement, providing timely improvements to both domestic dairy and mutton sheep populations and driving up the live weight of marketed mutton sheep. The annual increase in the average weight of live sheep marketed for auction demonstrates that domestic mutton farmers are making some effort in their management. On October 15, 2002, the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, held a meeting regarding the "Boer Goat Registration and Approval." Boer goats were imported from Australia in February 1995 under a special project and bred by the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Products Research Institute. After seven and a half years, the breed was approved for registration and officially launched in March 2003. Currently, many sheep farms in Taiwan have introduced Boer goats to improve the Nubian breed. While the benefits are still uncertain, it is expected that the average annual weight of live sheep marketed for auction will increase by another 3 to 5 kilograms within the next one to two years .

Driven by the promising domestic goat milk market starting in 1992, the domestic mutton industry experienced significant growth. By 1996, the number of sheep farmers reached 8,160, and the number of dairy and mutton sheep raised exceeded 400,000 by the end of 1995. The number of sheep slaughtered increased from 121,881 in 1994 to 179,591 in 1995, a 47.3% increase. Domestic mutton self-sufficiency also soared from 9.95% in 1994 to 18.18% in 1995. This exponential increase in supply ultimately led to a sharp drop in mutton prices in 1996. That same year, the domestic mutton self-sufficiency rate reached a record high of 20.75%, and 222,060 sheep were slaughtered. 1996 marked a watershed year for the sheep farming industry. The number of sheep farmers plummeted by over 2,000 that year, and the average annual price of sheep auctioned at the Yunlin County Meat Market reached an all-time low of NT$98.22 per kilogram, a 52.39% drop from the 1992 average of NT$206.30 and a 26.04% drop from the 1995 average of NT$132.80. Domestic sheep farmers learned a lesson from the 1996 price drop, recognizing for the first time the importance of balancing production and demand. Since then, with the exception of a 2001 decline in sheep trade due to the fake goat milk scandal and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, the industry has generally adjusted to a planned production model of decreasing production annually. This adjustment finally bore fruit in the second half of 2004, with a peak market price of NT$281 per kilogram reached in January 2005.

A robust mutton trading mechanism: Public auctions of mutton were first launched in Taiwan at the Yunlin County Meat Market in November 1988. Although only 3,595 head were traded in 1990, the transparency of the transaction, without the risk of default or bad debt, earned the approval of both sheep owners and sheep traders. By 1992, the number of auctioned heads had increased to 8,022. In the following years, stable prices provided convenience for sheep farmers and boosted confidence in supply and marketing. By 2004, the Yunlin County Meat Market had traded a staggering 33,971 head of sheep. The Fengshan District Meat Market added a mutton auction in 1991, attracting sheep from Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and Hualien-Taitung to its nearby auction area, contributing significantly to the stable development of the mutton industry. On November 27, 2000, the Changhua County Meat Market, following the Yunlin and Fengshan markets, also launched mutton auctions. The listing and trading of domestic mutton has seen positive changes since the Changhua County Meat Market joined the market. Simultaneously, based on market volatility theory, mutton auctions have gradually shifted toward Changhua and Yunlin, reflecting the fact that the main consumer base for domestic mutton lies north of the Chiayi-Nan region. In terms of the number of sheep auctioned, the Fengshan District Meat Market has seen a significant decline in its mutton auction business over the past five years, replaced by the Changhua County Meat Market. In 2004, the Fengshan District Meat Market auctioned only 3,918 head of mutton, while the Changhua County Meat Market auctioned 13,507. By August 2005, the gap had widened. Based on 2005 auction data, it is estimated that within the next one to two years, the mutton auction business between the Yunlin and Changhua County meat markets will gradually close. For most sheep farmers, the transparent and open information, healthy market competition, and robust trading platform of the mutton auction market, coupled with the fact that mutton auction proceeds can be received within three days, naturally contribute to their high willingness to continue raising sheep.

The industry is proactively looking inward: Over the past decade, the domestic sheep farming industry has weathered numerous shocks, and from these lessons, they have developed a crucial survival principle: it's better to rely on oneself than on others. On July 1, 1996, facing a sharp drop in sheep prices, domestic sheep farmers sought solutions from the then-Taiwan Provincial Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry. One month and 22 days later, 542 sheep farmers nationwide organized the Republic of China Sheep Farmers Association, hoping to revitalize the industry through this organization. In response to the sharp drop in sheep auction prices in 1996 and 1997, the Chiayi City Sheep Farmers Cooperative invested over NT$70 million in 1998 to build the first domestically produced lamb butchering plant in an effort to reassure consumers of the superior quality of domestic lamb. Although this facility was unable to compete with lower-priced imported lamb, it clearly demonstrates the sheep farmers' determination to survive. On February 15 and 23, 2000, two outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in sheep occurred. To make matters worse , on February 21 and April 12, newspapers reported that "over 30% of flavored goat milk is mixed with cow's milk" and "30% of goat milk tablets are mixed with cow's milk." This series of events led to a 40% loss in the domestic goat milk market, and the average auction price of mutton in 2001 fell another 15.36% compared to 2000.

Faced with dramatic changes in the industry, the Sheep Farmers Association of the Republic of China, under the guidance of the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, and with the assistance of industry, government, and academia, held the "First Seminar on the Certification and Issuance of the Goat Milk Label" on February 15, 2000, the same day that the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak occurred in sheep. Subsequently, after 12 seminars and with the general consensus of domestic goat milk processing companies, the goat milk label certification was launched on October 12, 2001. As of August 2005, 170 million goat milk label stickers had been issued, not only regaining the existing market, but also setting a new record for domestic goat milk sales and boosting the operating efficiency of the mutton industry.

Regarding the legal slaughter of domestic mutton, mutton roasters in Xihu Town, Changhua County, raised funds to build Taiwan's first dedicated electric slaughtering line within the Changhua County Meat Market. This professional slaughtering system ensures the hygiene and safety of domestic mutton carcasses. Between 1999 and 2000 , sanitary slaughtering of domestic mutton was implemented at the Yunlin County and Chiayi City meat markets, but the number of slaughtered sheep was small. In 2003 , the Central Livestock Association, in collaboration with the Council of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Bureau, advocated that mutton be sent to legal slaughterhouses for slaughter. That same year, only 5,484 domestic mutton were sanitary inspected . By April 2004 , Xiangmeng Livestock Company's first dedicated sheep slaughtering line was operational, and domestic mutton slaughter numbers soared, reaching a total of 17,258 in 2004. From January to July 2005 , 16,003 domestic mutton were sanitary inspected. It is worth noting that the proportion of mutton listed for auction that is slaughtered directly in the meat market is increasing.

Steady and planned production: In recent years, the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, has actively supported the sheep farming industry, particularly through surveys of sheep farm basic data and production dynamics, as well as analyses of domestic mutton production costs and efficiency. These efforts provide valuable insights into the overall supply and demand of domestic mutton production, thereby stabilizing the industry's trajectory. Regarding domestic mutton production costs, statistical data provided by the Council of Agriculture allows mutton farmers to adjust their mid-year expenditure increases and decreases. Combined with the transparency of mutton auction market prices, mutton farmers can predict operating profits and losses, eliminating the need for blind guessing and avoiding the same fate of losing everything. A comparison of the estimated annual production targets for domestic mutton and raw goat milk production over the past two years with actual production data shows a strong correlation, demonstrating the importance of conducting a census of breeding dynamics within the industry and the necessity of adhering to planned production. In the past five or six years, the domestic production cost of mutton has remained roughly between 117 and 130 yuan per kilogram. Therefore, if the number of sheep produced and the number of sheep put on the market for slaughter can be further adjusted, attention can be paid to the fluctuations in the amount of imported mutton, and transparent operations can be carried out, the risk of industry instability will naturally be greatly reduced.

A recent survey of mutton costs conducted by the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, reveals that sheep farmers are struggling to reduce costs, including fowl costs, feed costs, and even labor costs. As for mutton farmers' efficiency, the average number of pigs born per litter, the average number of weaned pigs per litter, and the birth-to-weaning success rate have largely remained consistent, with no significant improvement. From another perspective, this is precisely why the sheep farming industry struggles to expand and is prone to experiencing zero growth.

A key factor in determining the future prospects of Taiwan's mutton industry lies in its ability to adapt independently. By setting annual production targets through agricultural agencies and industry groups, and through consensus among mutton farmers, mutton traders, and mutton hotpot operators, standardized output and an open trading platform can create a balanced production and marketing channel year-round. This, in turn, suggests there's still room for growth in the domestic mutton industry. In particular, domestic sheep farming is often confined, resulting in minimal pollution and no risk of soil and water conservation. Furthermore, facing the regular price increases of bulk imported raw materials, Taiwan's mutton industry can respond with domestically produced agricultural and sideline products. With comprehensive supporting measures in place, this industry should be a worthy and highly competitive one, both for increased production and forage. Ultimately, domestic lamb, like domestic pork and chicken, must meet national domestic product hygiene standards from breeding, slaughtering, cutting to packaging and refrigeration. This is especially true in special channels where lamb hot pot is the primary sales target. A verification mechanism should be in place, coupled with legal and hygienic slaughtering, immediate meat quality testing, and even the establishment of a domestic lamb mitochondrial gene barcoding system. This aims to give Chinese people greater confidence in consuming safe, hygienic, and healthy domestic lamb, while also preparing for entry into the international lamb market.

Taiwan's mutton industry need not limit itself to supplying the domestic market. After more than a decade of introduction and improvement, Taiwan's Nubian breed, a dual-purpose dairy and meat breed, has incorporated superior genetics from American and Australian Nubian sheep, creating a superior stock adapted to tropical and subtropical conditions. Once foot-and-mouth disease is eradicated, it should stand out among international goat breed competition. Regarding the continued influx of cheap Australian and New Zealand lamb into Taiwan, domestic mutton farmers should remain calm and diligently prepare for market differentiation. After all, under a free trade economy and a free consumer consciousness, as more and more consumers choose to eat lamb, domestic lamb will have the opportunity to showcase its superior characteristics and allow consumers to prove that it is indeed one of the finest livestock products.

Dairy sheep breeds: Currently, the main breeds registered by the American Dairy Sheep Association (ADGA) include: Saanen , Alpine, Toggenburg, Nubian, LaMancha, and Oberhasli: six. Other advanced livestock-raising countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, primarily rely on the first four, while France primarily relies on Albanian and Saanen. Taiwan used to import these breeds from the United States, New Zealand, and Australia, but the dairy sheep breeds currently raised by sheep farmers have gradually simplified to focus on Albanian and Saanen, with Albanian accounting for 70% of the total.

Albaine: Albaines are divided into five strains based on their breeding region: English, French, Swiss, Rock, and Australian. The English Albaine has a solid black coat with white stripes on the sides of the face, and white on the ischial tips of the tail and below the knees. The Swiss Albaine is now officially registered as the Oberhasli breed. The Rock Albaine was bred by Mrs. Rock, and very few remain. The French Albaine is currently the most common breed in both the United States and Taiwan. In recent years, a new breed, originally registered as the Melan, has been developed and registered in Australia. It is now available to some sheep farmers in Taiwan. The French Albaine is a medium to large breed, with ewes at least 76 cm tall and weighing over 57 kg; rams at least 81 cm tall and weighing over 77 kg. Both male and female sheep have beards, straight noses, erect ears, slightly protruding eyes, and may or may not have horns. They are alert and agile. Although docile with their owners, they are more aggressive toward other sheep than other dairy sheep breeds. French Albaines in the United States have no fixed coat color; they can be a mix of black, white, reddish-brown, gray, and brown, but they avoid the typical coat colors of Tuggenheim and Sanen. The American Albaine can be generally categorized into eight different color types: Cou Blanc, Cou Clair, Cou Noir, Pied, Sundgau, Chamoisee, Two-tone Chamoisee, and Broken Chamoisee. Five of the more common color types are as follows: Cou Blanc: white on the neck and shoulders, with black hindquarters; Cou Clair: brown on the neck, black on the hindquarters; Cou Noir: black on the forequarters, white on the hindquarters; Chamoisee: chestnut or brown throughout, with black on the head, neck, backline, and legs; Sundgau: black throughout, with white stripes along the sides of the face, and white below the knees and on both sides of the tail, like the English Albaine. However, in France, only a single brown coat with black trim (Chamoisee) remains. Originally from the French Alps, the Albaine is hardy, tolerant of long journeys, and well adapted to various climates. It is very tolerant of rough husbandry and has a high lambing rate. Ewes have a long lactation period, and their average milk production is second only to the Saanen internationally. In the United States, milk production has reached 1,800 kilograms in just 305 days a year. Due to the aforementioned advantages of the Albain, and the fact that its coat coloration is predominantly black and brown, fattened dairy rams command a higher per-kilogram price than the Saanen at Taiwan's mutton auctions. Consequently, they are highly sought after by sheep farmers and are gradually replacing the Saanen as the mainstream dairy sheep breed. For many years, the largest number of Albain sheep have been imported to Taiwan from the United States, with a small number also coming from Australia. In recent years , the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Husbandry Research Institute and private businesses have begun importing frozen semen from French brown Albain sheep, hoping to genetically improve milk production and composition through corrective breeding. 

The Saanen is a large breed of sheep originating from the Saanen Valley in Switzerland and the world's most populous dairy sheep breed. Its coat is white or creamy white. Its skin is pink or tan. Some sheep may have black spots around the udder, eyes, ears, and nose, but this is still acceptable for breed registration. For sheep raised outdoors in tropical regions, pigmented skin protects against UV rays and sunburn, so tan skin has become a selection criterion in the Australian Saanen breed. Saanen sheep have erect, slightly forward-tilted ears, a straight or slightly concave nose, horns, and often two wattles around their necks. They are docile and quieter than other dairy sheep breeds, rarely engaging in serious fighting, bullying, or jumping fences. Both male and female sheep may have tan hair. In temperate climates, Saanen sheep often have long hair on their backs and thighs, and males also have bangs. Long-wool sheep, imported into Taiwan, typically undergo varying degrees of molting to adapt to the subtropical climate. Adult ewes are at least 76 cm tall and weigh over 61 kg; rams are at least 81 cm tall and weigh over 85 kg. Purebred Saanen sheep may occasionally produce lambs with black or other coat colors, known in the United States as Sable. Some American sheep farmers are developing a new breed from this. Congenitally hornless Saanen sheep are common. When both male and female sheep are congenitally hornless, the offspring are likely to be hermaphroditic or intersex. These sheep have a small vulva but a prominent clitoris. The distance between the vulva and the anus is larger than that of normal ewes. The reproductive tract is underdeveloped, and testicular tissue is often present in the ovaries. Most are infertile. Therefore, when selecting breeding sheep, ewes may be allowed to be hornless, while rams that are congenitally horned are preferred. Saanen ewes have a high milk yield and a long lactation period, averaging approximately 1,000 kg of milk over 305 days. Annual production of 2,000 kg is common in temperate regions, making them the highest milk producers among dairy sheep breeds. The current world record for milk production is held by an Australian Saanen ewe named Osory Snowgoose, who produced a whopping 3,582 kg of milk in her second calving over 365 days. Consequently, Saanen sheep are known as the "Dutch cattle" of dairy sheep. The milk fat percentage is generally 3.5%, and the protein content is 3.0-3.2%. Despite their high milk yield, Saanen sheep have poor tolerance to heat and rough conditions, making them suitable for more intensive husbandry. Taiwan's Saanen sheep were originally imported from Japan, and in the past decade, some have also been imported from New Zealand and Australia, though the largest number of imports still comes from the United States.

The Toggenburg is native to Switzerland and is most numerous in the Obertg-genburg region, hence the name. The Toggenburg's coat color is fixed, ranging from light coffee to dark chocolate. However, there is a white stripe on each side of the face from the base of the ear to the tip of the nose. The ears, below the visor, and where the neck wattles are attached are white. There is an inverted triangular white patch on each side of the rump at the base of the tail. Creamy white is acceptable, but white is preferred. The Toggenburg has erect ears and hair of varying lengths, with some sheep having long hair on the back, lower abdomen, and thighs. Slightly shorter than other breeds, it is a medium-sized breed. Ewes are at least 66 cm tall and weigh over 55 kg; rams are at least 71 cm tall and weigh over 70 kg. The udder of the Toggenburg sheep is firmly attached to the body wall, resulting in a plump, spherical milk. Lactation is long, and some ewes can continue milking for up to two years after calving, even without re-breeding. Because they can adapt to a wide range of climates, their milk production is relatively unaffected by latitude and season. They produce an average of 700-900 kg of milk in 305 days, resulting in high-quality milk suitable for producing dry cheese.

The LaMncha is the only dairy sheep breed bred in the United States. Originally developed by crossbreeding short-eared Spanish Murciana females with Swiss dairy rams, it was not registered with the American Dairy Sheep Association until 1958. LaMnchas have a straight nose, may or may not have horns, and have short, fine fur of varying color. They are a medium to large breed, with ewes standing over 71 cm tall and weighing 59 kg; rams stand over 76 cm tall and weigh over 73 kg. Short ears are characteristic of this breed, and there are two types of ears: the gopher type , with external ears less than 2.5 cm long and devoid of cartilage. Most sheep lack external ears, forming only a wrinkle. The American Dairy Sheep Association requires LaMncha rams to have gopher ears for registration. The other type is the Elf type, with external ears approximately 5 cm long, no longer than 7.6 cm, and drooping ear tips. Cartilage is permitted. Elf ears are not permitted in breeding rams. The main reason for this is that these rams may carry the recessive gene for the normal ear shape from the Swiss breed, resulting in offspring with ears that do not meet the breed standard. The Lai Man Jiao is robust and resistant to rough handling, with an average milk fat content of 4%. Average milk production is slightly lower than that of Swiss dairy sheep, but it has good meat characteristics and can be used as a dairy and beef breed.

The Nubian, officially known as the Anglo-Nubian, is a cross between British dairy goats and tropical sheep breeds such as the Zaraibi from Nubia in North Africa and the Jamnapari from India, which are characterized by prominent noses and long, drooping ears. The Nubian's defining characteristic is its hooked nose, also known as the Roman face, inherited from tropical breeds, and its long, drooping ears, which extend approximately 2.5 cm beyond the nose tip when held close to the cheek. Nubians have no fixed coat color, but brown is the most common. The American Dairy Sheep Association accepts all Nubian colors for registration, but the UK and Australia do not allow white facial stripes or wattles, characteristic of Swiss breeds. Nubian sheep are tall, with short, smooth wool, and excellent reproductive performance. They have a higher litter rate than other dairy sheep breeds and tend to produce multiple births. Due to their tropical ancestry, their breeding season is over two months longer than that of other European breeds, resulting in superior meat quality compared to other dairy sheep breeds. Ewes are over 76 cm tall and weigh over 62 kg, while rams are over 81 cm tall and weigh over 100 kg, making them a large dairy and meat breed. Their tropical ancestry makes them well-suited to Taiwan's climate and, over the past 20 years, have made the greatest contribution to the improvement of Taiwanese meat sheep breeds. Nubian milk has a high fat content of 5.0%, but yields are lower than other European breeds, and the lactation period is shorter. Once pregnant, milk production decreases rapidly. However, due to its rich milk, some dairy farms use Nubian milk to adjust the fat content and density of their summer milk to meet the minimum milk collection standards of dairy factories.

The Oberhasli, formerly known as the Swiss Alpine, is a dairy sheep breed bred in the Oberhasli-Brienzer Alps region of Switzerland. Its coat is a monochromatic color, primarily light to dark reddish-brown, but features a black stripe on each side of the face, running from above the eyes to the tip of the nose. Its forehead is nearly black, and its topline, underbelly, and below the visor are all black. The Oberhasli has a thinner frame than the French Albaine, a gentler temperament, and an alert and energetic appearance. It is a medium-sized breed, with ewes standing over 71 cm tall and weighing over 54 kg; rams standing over 76 cm tall and weighing over 68 kg. Its average yield in 305 days is approximately 725 kg, and this breed remains rare in the United States. Taiwanese sheep farmers imported Oberhasli from the United States in the 1980s, but the numbers are very small. Because its milk production is not as good as that of the French Albaine, it is now a rare sight on Taiwanese dairy farms.

Centuries of experience have honed the correlation between a sheep's appearance, body conformation, lactation performance, and economic lifespan. The sheep industry has long established an ideal type for dairy sheep, using this as a basis for competitions and breeding selection. Therefore, the ideal type is not merely aesthetically pleasing; more importantly, it represents the ewe's optimal production performance and longevity. While the ideal type is difficult to find in the real world, it is a crucial criterion for judges in sheep competitions and for sheep farmers when selecting or selecting breeding sheep. Knowledge and skills in body conformation assessment are invaluable in sheep flock management and breeding improvement.

Goat dentition formula and age identification: Goats have a permanent dentition formula of 0033/4033, lacking upper incisors and canines. The age at which deciduous and permanent teeth erupt is determined by the eruption of all eight incisors around the age of four. After four years of age, age can only be determined by the wear of the incisors. However, the degree of tooth wear varies depending on the type of diet and can only be used as a guide for age determination.

Linear ap. praisal evaluation of dairy sheep: The primary purpose of this evaluation is to objectively assess the influence of sires on the inheritance of traits in their offspring by analyzing differences in physical appearance among individual sheep and their correlation with lactation and lifespan. This serves as a reference for individual sheep selection and breed improvement. Currently, the American Dairy Sheep Association and the French Dairy Sheep Improvement Association have established evaluation criteria and standards, and routinely accept applications from farmers for evaluation annually.

Taking the American Dairy Sheep Association's linear body evaluation as an example, 13 main traits of ewes are evaluated, with each trait scored from 5 to 50 points. However, this system does not set a certain score to represent the ideal. In other words, the higher the score of some traits, the more ideal they are. The scores of each trait marked in bold represent the most ideal body shape.

French dairy sheep are evaluated linearly based on 17 traits, including three body traits (chest girth, topline, and hip slope); three hind leg traits (hock distance, hoof distance, and pastern angle); and 11 udder traits (front attachment, udder firmness, udder depth, rear attachment, central suspensory ligament, teat spacing, teat angle, teat orientation, teat shape, teat diameter, and teat length). The three body traits exhibit less variation among ewes and are less important than the udder traits. Among the udder traits, four traits —udder firmness (US) , udder depth (UD) , rear attachment (RA) , and central suspensory ligament (CL) —are the most important. Albain and Sanen dairy sheep have phenotypic and genetic differences in udder firmness, so the evaluation index is different. Albain: 1.5US+1UD+IRA+1CL , and Sanen: IUS+UD+1RA+0.5CL .

Progeny Testing of Dairy Rams: In advanced livestock-raising countries such as the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and France, in addition to establishing relevant associations or organizations to register the pedigrees of purebred dairy sheep, they also implement dairy herd improvement (DHI) programs. Milk volume and composition are measured monthly for registered lactating sheep, beginning with the lactation period following calving. Because the genetics of stud rams significantly influence the milk production of their offspring, and stud rams themselves do not lactate, dairy rams must undergo progeny testing to assess their genetic ability to lactate based on the lactation performance of their offspring. This is especially true for stud rams intended to produce frozen semen for widespread artificial insemination, which are particularly important.

Under the French dairy sheep improvement program, the best parental combinations are selected and bred through artificial insemination. The resulting rams are then weaned at three months of age and then reared in a quarantined artificial insemination center for progeny testing. Between three and seven months of age, the rams undergo an initial screening for conformation, growth rate, and reproductive health. Selected rams are placed in individual pens between seven and nine months of age and begin 15 semen collections to assess their reproductive function. Semen collections are performed twice weekly for young rams and three to five times weekly for mature rams. The purpose of semen collection and testing is to eliminate rams that are unsuitable for prosthetic vaginas (approximately 10%), have an ejaculate volume of less than 0.2 mL per ejaculation or a sperm concentration of less than 1 billion per mL (approximately 15%), and produce semen that is not freeze-resistant (approximately 25%). Ultimately, only about half of the rams are selected for continued semen collection and production of frozen semen. This frozen semen is then used for artificial insemination at various dairy farms. Each dairy farm provides at least 30 ewes for artificial insemination, and each ram's frozen semen is used to inseminate at least 200 ewes. This results in the production of approximately 40 female goats for progeny testing. Because goats are seasonal breeders, progeny testing is completed when rams reach approximately four years of age.

Auction Competitions: Sheep competitions are very popular in Europe, America, New Zealand, and Australia. Each country has established a dairy sheep association to manage matters such as the registration and competition of breeding sheep, and regularly holds regional and national competitions every year. In addition to being a leisure activity, the main purpose of breeding sheep competitions is to select sheep with superior body shape through evaluation and explanation by professional judges, providing participants and spectators with opportunities for education, observation, and learning, and allowing sheep farmers to breed ideal sheep. In addition, competitions can bring together participants from all over the world to achieve the purpose of connecting with each other and exchanging sheep-raising experiences. They can also attract general audiences and beginners and cultivate an interest in sheep farming. At the same time, whether or not there is an auction of the participating sheep at the competition, it can increase the opportunity for sheep to be traded. Sheep competitions are generally divided into categories such as breed, gender, and age. The American Dairy Sheep Association categorizes ewes into females and lactating ewes. Females are further divided into three categories: 2-5 months old, 6-11 months old, and 12-24 months old. Lactating ewes are further divided into three categories: 1-2 years old, 2-3 years old, and 3 years old and older. Two weeks before competing, sheep must undergo a grooming session. This includes trimming hooves, removing stumps, shaving, leaving a tuft of hair at the end of the tail, and brushing to remove residual hair and dandruff. Before competing, sheep must practice using collars and leashes to accustom them to interacting with strangers and prevent them from panicking in the arena. Additionally, ear tattoos must be inspected for legibility, and registration certificates must be prepared for inspection. On the day of competition, sheep must be groomed and groomed if necessary.

The transformation of primitive local livestock breeds into modern, improved breeds began with the British farmer Robert Bakewell (1725-1790). R. Bakewell can be considered the father of modern livestock breeding. In the 1760s, he first kept a record of the descendants of his own sheep for breeding selection, initiating a personal stock registration system. To improve the performance of farm animals, he compared the bones of retired breeding stock, or used preservatives to create specimens of retired breeding stock, and then compared the performance of their offspring. This method of offspring testing, or pedigree selection, is still used today. Bakewell also possessed a keen eye, similar to the skill of a horse expert in the Warring States Period of China. He accurately selected livestock for meat or draft based on their appearance, and first improved the meat quality of Leicester sheep. At the time, genetics and its scientific foundation were not yet established. However, they did understand the concept that livestock traits are passed down from parent to offspring, and that good offspring must be selected from good parents. They also focused on body shape and appearance, favoring fine bones and high meat content for meat production, and prioritizing early maturity and early fattening. Blood is thicker than water, and to ensure that good traits are passed down to offspring, they resorted to inbreeding to select the best and eliminate the worst, a theory that remains valid today. The 1804 breeding of the Shorthorn bull Comet, with a high inbreeding coefficient (46.87%), led to the establishment of a national stock registration system in the United Kingdom, marking the beginning of modern stock breeding. Thanks to the development of livestock registration, Britain became a global exporter of a wide variety of livestock and a global superpower.

Sheep are classified in the phylum Vertebrata , class Mammalia, subclass Placentalia , order Unglata , suborder Paridigitata, order Ruminantias , family Cavicornia , subfamily Caprininae , genus Capra , or genus Ovis, respectively, as either species Capra hircus (goat) or species Ovis aries ( sheep ). Goat and sheep breeds belong to the genera Capra and Ovis , respectively , and interbreeding is not possible. Improved goat breeds are mostly bred for dairy, followed by meat, with very few breeds for wool. Conversely, improved sheep breeds are mostly bred for wool production, and are also mostly bred for meat, with very few breeds for milk production. Sheep outnumber goats in both breed and number of improved breeds. Sheep are more common in developed countries at higher latitudes in temperate and cold climates. Sheep and goats are distinguished from each other and are not simply referred to as sheep. Unimproved goats are more common in developing countries at lower latitudes. Since only goats are bred locally, they are simply referred to as sheep, without distinguishing between goats and sheep.

The history of meat sheep, or goats, in Taiwan has been a tumultuous one. Before the influx of Han Chinese into Taiwan, the native goats were of the Austronesian variety. Their coats varied in color, including shades of brown, gray, black, and white. Much larger than the native black goats of southern China, they lived in scattered herds in the woods, much like wild goats naturally colonizing in an environment devoid of predators. By the 16th century, when Han Chinese migrated to coastal areas of southern China, they brought with them Chinese black goats. However, these black goats were not able to crossbreed with the original Austronesian Taiwanese goats, which had already devoured the larger native goats in western Taiwan. By the late 19th century, when the Japanese took control of Taiwan, the original Austronesian goats were no longer found in western Taiwan, leaving only the black goats brought by the Han Chinese. The original Austronesian goats still survived in the undeveloped eastern regions of Hualien and Taitung, bordered by the Central Mountain Range.

Nearly a hundred years before the turn of the 20th century, to improve the native black goats, Chang Linglin (1907) published a Taiwanese goat-herding experiment in the Taiwan Farmers' Association Bulletin, which resulted in the whitening of black-soil goats. White is dominant over all other goat coat colors, followed by brown, gray, and black (cream, brown, and black), followed by red (red and tan). Cream is the most dominant of the black coats, while black is the most recessive. Furthermore, white markings on a black background are dominant over all solid colors. However, this dominance is not a simple opposing gene, but rather a more complex interaction of complementary genes. The darker line on the back, known as the eel line, is recessive.

Crossbreeding native black goats with improved goat breeds like Saoneng results in whiter coats, but also increased size, which improves milk and meat production. Ono (1910) published a survey of goat breeding in Beitou in the Taiwan Agricultural Newspaper (台农事), finding that farmers disliked the change in coat color, hindering goat improvement. Unfortunately, after World War I (June 1914-November 1918), sheep wool became an important military supply. Advanced countries competed to develop sheep wool production and the related wool textile industry. Yanagawa (1919) published a paper on the origins of sheep in Taiwan at the Taiwan Agricultural Bureau, Miyamoto (1919) wrote about how to select Merino sheep and the nature of sheep, and Ito (1920) published a paper on sheep breeding and management methods. These papers all focused on sheep. Taiwan also shifted its focus from developing goats to developing sheep. In the hot summer, Merino sheep and Japanese Corriedale sheep were introduced to conduct experimental research and development of Taiwan's sheep industry. The Department of Animal Science and Technology (formerly the Department of Animal Husbandry) at National Taiwan University now retains various measuring instruments used to study wool characteristics during the period of Taipei Imperial University. After this transformation, Taiwan's goat industry became neglected and undervalued for half a century. Following World War II, Taiwan was again subjected to China's lack of livestock technology, which imposed a harsh "cow food, goat food" motto. This severely suppressed the development of goats, further devastating the postwar goat industry, leaving farmers to secretly raise them to survive. In March 1997, at the end of the 20th century, Taiwan was struck by foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a devastating international epidemic that had been absent for over 80 years. The pre-pandemic livestock industry reached its peak, and the goat industry, regardless of whether it was dairy or meat, was revived thanks to the intensified research and development efforts of the Animal Products Research Institute. In 1996, goat farmers established a goat breeding association to vigorously develop the industry.

The strength of a country's agriculture significantly impacts its national power, and developed nations like Europe, America, and Japan are often considered dairy-producing nations. Therefore, the GI ratio is used to assess the strength of a country's agriculture. G stands for grass and grazing, and I stands for intensive and industrial. This refers to the ratio of the number of herbivorous livestock, such as cattle and sheep, to the number of non-herbivorous pigs and chickens, within a country's livestock industry that does not compete with humans for food and contributes to land conservation. The G/I ratio for developed European and American countries ranges from 6 to 8, while Japan's is 1. This indicates that countries with excessively high G/I ratios, such as those in India or Brazil, which only graze cattle, are not considered advanced. However, China's G/I ratio has not yet reached a decimal point of 1, indicating a preponderance of intensively farmed pigs and chickens and a shortage of locally farmed cattle and sheep. This G/I ratio reveals the importance of developing dairy-related sheep farming in China's agriculture, making it a crucial industry that deserves focused resources and efforts.

With the exception of the Black Belly sheep (hair sheep, not wool) presented as a gift by the King of Barbados during President Yen Chia-kan's visit to Central America in 1975, all sheep in Taiwan are goats, and are therefore generally referred to as sheep. Taiwan's dairy goats are primarily the Saanen, which were introduced nearly a century ago. Four other breeds exist: the Albanian, Nubian, and Toggenburg. A study by Sung et al. (1999) found that the Albanian has the lowest somatic cell count in milk of these four breeds, with over 80% of its milk meeting US Grade A (GA) standards. Saanen also achieved 73%, Nubian 49%, and Toggenburg 41%. This difference is due to the smooth interaction between the milk production genes of the improved goats and the interaction between genetics and the environment. This indicates that Albain, Sanen, and Nubian sheep have excellent milk production, resulting in better growth and potential for meat production. This genetic relationship not only exists between breeds, but also within breeds and between individuals. Therefore, it is urgent to register the pedigrees of all purebred sheep to facilitate the selection of the best and the worst, and to improve and preserve the breed locally, ensuring that each generation of sheep is better than the previous one, thus ensuring successful and profitable sheep farming. Currently, the national purebred sheep registration program is managed by the Central Animal Husbandry Association, with the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute fully cooperating in the development of pedigree registration software.

The most important part of the registration work in our country is that each sheep farmer fills in the pedigree registration information. The pedigree registration information includes (1) the ewe breeding daily report, that is, when the ewe is breeding, the name of the ram, ear marking number, pedigree registration number, and the method and date of breeding are filled in the ewe breeding daily report and sent to the livestock group breeding sheep registration work team of the Central Livestock Association for registration and filing. The registration is also filled in when the ewe gives birth; (2) the lamb birth registration card. The lamb birth registration card is filled in with the date of birth, parity, number of litters (i.e., the number of male and female lambs), and the name and registration number of the sire, etc. The computer is checked and verified on the ewe breeding daily report at that time. The registration is automatically completed after the registration is completed. Therefore, the sheep farmer filling in such pedigree registration information is the first step in the registration of purebred sheep, and it is also the beginning of the registration of breeding sheep in our country, rather than completing the registration of breeding sheep by applying for transfer registration of imported registered breeding sheep in our country. For those who raise purebred ewes, the testing project for measuring the milk production capacity of their ewes is also ready to be carried out, which will definitely significantly improve the milk and meat production capacity of goats.

Individual direct testing of goat meat production should also be implemented to understand the growth performance of various breeds in China and serve as a basis for selecting the best and eliminating the worst. The simplest and most feasible method for testing goat meat production performance is to establish a meat production testing station. Registered weaned rams weighing 30 kg or more with pedigrees from local goat farmers are collected. The initial weight is then measured one week after arrival. Thereafter, the weight is measured every 50 days, with a final weight at day 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, and 500. The final weight is then calculated based on the growth rate (coefficient of growth) during each growth period, understanding the growth curve, and determining the optimal age and weight for market or sale that maximizes economic production efficiency. Growth rate is calculated by taking W1 as the initial weight and W2 as the final weight. The growth rate for each growth period is calculated as (W2/W1) × 100 , or [(W2-W1)W1] × 100. When the nutritional environment conditions for W1 and W2 differ, [(W2-W1)/1/2(W1+W2)] × 100 is more accurate. At the end of the test, the results are announced based on the ranking of growth rates. During the test, the growth rate for each period can also be calculated as the average daily gain (ADR ) of (W2-W1)/(T2-T1) = dW/dT . While growth rate increases or decreases with age in a geometric progression, this daily gain (DG) can be used as a reference in meat sheep testing.

Meat sheep breeds: All livestock, including sheep, regardless of whether they are sheep or goats, can be used for meat, especially the unimproved native sheep of each country, which are all used for meat. Therefore, improved sheep breeds are mostly used for wool production, or goats improved for milk production. The meat sheep breeds here refer to improved sheep breeds improved for meat production. If we look at the amount of mutton traded globally, mutton (Mutton) is the main type, but in our country, goat meat is the most popular , especially the local black goat meat.

In reality, the importance of goat breeds for milk or meat versus sheep breeds for wool or internal use, much like the importance of beef cattle for meat, milk, or both, varies by breed, within the same breed, and within different countries. Taking the total milk or wool use of goats or sheep as 10, the meat-to-milk ratio for meat sheep is 6:4 or higher. Conversely, for dairy sheep, the meat-to-milk ratio should be 4:6 or higher. For dairy-to-meat sheep, the ratio should be 4.5:5.5, 5:5, or 5.5:4.5. Similarly, for meat sheep, the meat-to-wool ratio is 6:4 or higher. For wool sheep, the meat-to-wool ratio should be 4:6 or higher. For both wool and meat sheep, the ratio should be 4.5:5.5, 5:5, or 5.5:4.5. Furthermore, the body shapes and appearances of dairy and meat sheep are relatively similar, unlike the distinct body shapes and appearances of dairy and meat cattle, as shown in Figure 2-2-1 in Section 2 above. When China introduces improved dairy sheep to breed meat sheep, it is crucial to guide their body shapes and appearance towards those of meat sheep in order to achieve success. Differences in appearance and appearance between meat and dairy sheep.

Nubian : Originating from the wild goat (Capraibex) of East Africa, the Nubian sheep is a cross between other dairy goats. They have dense, short hair, a short head with a prominent jaw, a long neck, large, flat, drooping ears (fapeared) , and a hooked nose ( Roman nose ) , distinguishing them from other dairy goats. Their coat can be chestnut, white, brown, or black. They are small, with long limbs and no body width. Their body shape is similar to that of a Saanen, but they lack the wale or beard and are smaller. They are generally hornless, though occasionally males have spiral horns. The original Nubian sheep are now rare. The Nubian sheep found in China are a modified breed introduced from the UK. The full name of the Nubian is the Anglo Nubian , a large, improved dairy sheep created by crossbreeding African Nubian sheep with native British dairy goats. It was registered as a breed in 1909. Nubian sheep have good growth performance and are highly productive, typically giving birth to two or three babies. While their milk production is not as high as that of Saanen or Albain sheep, their milk fat content is 4.0-6.5%. They are more tolerant of rough handling and easier to manage than other dairy sheep, making them well-suited to tropical environments. The average male height is 90.6±0.8 cm, body length is 101.6±4.5 cm, and chest circumference is 107.8±3.8 cm. The average female height is 77.1±4.8 cm, body length is 89.2±5.6 cm, and chest circumference is 94.4±6.6 cm. A year-old male ram reaches market weight of 70 kg, stands 81 cm tall, and is 92.3 cm long. The slaughter rate is 60%, and the carcass lean meat content is as high as 68%. Most of the existing Nubian sheep in Taiwan are descendants of the American Nubian, specifically the Anglo Nubian. The Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute reintroduced Nubian sheep in 1985 and has been breeding and promoting them for crossbreeding with Black Earth goats.

At the Hengchun branch ( Hong et al., 1987) , crossbreeding Nubian rams with Black Earth ewes resulted in a high farrowing rate of 210.7% and a triplet rate of 32.2% . The farrowing rates of Taiwanese Black goats and their crossbreedings during the same period were 152.2 and 150.0 , respectively. This demonstrates the excellent reproductive success of Nubian sheep in Taiwan. Similar results were observed at breeding farms in Hualien and Taitung, with the crossbreedings still outperforming subsequent progressive goats. Meanwhile, the average daily gain of finishing rams was 0.18 kg , with a feed efficiency of 6.26 . The average daily gain of crossbreedings with Black Earth goats, for both the first and second generations, after weaning was 0.12 kg and 0.10 kg , respectively. The conception rate of the crossbreedings reached 87.5% , with a high farrowing rate of 46.4% for twins and 32.2% for triplets . Nubian sheep are not only an excellent meat sheep in Taiwan, but also one of the four major dairy sheep breeds. In the United States, the certified lactation period for Nubian sheep is 10 months, with a total milk yield of 1,455 kg , resulting in a milk-to-meat ratio of 6 : 4 . In Taiwan, the milk-to-meat ratio is 5.5 : 4.5 or 5 : 5 , resulting in a higher meat yield than in developed countries, making it a dual-purpose breed.

The Boer Goat, a native meat goat, appeared in South Africa in the early 1900s. Its appearance and build are similar to the original Nubian goat before it was modified, making it the world's only relatively primitive meat goat breed. However, due to epidemics in Africa, importation into developed countries like Europe and the United States has been strictly prohibited for nearly three-quarters of a century. By the 1970s, it began to appear in German universities and in Australia in the 1980s. However, after six years of prolonged quarantine, the new meat goat was officially released between 1993 and 1995. Since then, the number of Boer goats raised has increased dramatically. Whether bred as purebreds or crossbred with other dairy goats, the selected and improved Boer goats have significantly improved goat meat production in Australia, with significant improvements in tolerance to rough conditions, growth, meat production, and slaughter rate. In addition to farmed Boer goats, an estimated 4 million Boer goats are now available for slaughter annually in the wild. This has contributed to Australia, which controls half of the world's mutton exports, becoming a major exporter of purebred Boer goats, and has established a global Boer goat industry. The United States established the National Boer Goat Association in 1997 to coordinate pedigree registration and development efforts among state Boer goat associations. In 1995, the Hengchun Branch of the National Animal Research Institute of Taiwan imported 13 Boer goats, two males and 11 females, from Australia to provide new genetic resources for Taiwan's meat sheep industry. Boer goats are large, heat-tolerant, and easy to raise, and crossbreeding with them has accelerated the improvement of meat sheep. Boer goats have a long, dense, and lustrous coat. Their eyelids, eyes, and other hairless areas are dark gray in color. The skin is thin, soft, and loose. Their head and the first 10 cm from the neck are brown or nearly red, while the rest of their carcass and limbs are typically white. Some may have brown-red markings on the carcass. Boer Sheep Associations consider the former purebred Boer goats, while those with brown-red markings on the carcass are advanced breeds. Boer goats have strong, broad heads, but are gentle and composed, with a prominent forehead. Their horns are round, yellowish-white, of medium length, curved upward and downward, with thicker gray tips. Their ears are long, wide, and drooping, resembling Nubian ears. Their eyes are large, brown, almond-shaped, and their noses resemble the hooked, or Roman, Nubian nose, with wide, flared nostrils that tip in line with the lower lip. The upper and lower jaws are even, not prominent, and the bite is correct, though the lower jaw may protrude slightly after 4-5 years of age. The neck is of medium length and proportionate to the carcass, blending smoothly into the thorax. The chest is broad, deep, and well-muscled, with a wide, but not prominent, buttocks. The midsection is long, broad, deep, with well-developed ribs. The back is broad, flat, and well-muscled, blending smoothly behind the shoulders with only a slight concavity. The hindquarters are broad, flat, and flat, with the loin extending from the ischial tuberosity to the rump. The glutes and thighs are well-muscled and extend downward, and the tail is set high and flat. The leg length is moderate in proportion to the carcass, with a strong, well-developed pastern, a square stance, and flat, rather than rounded, calf bones, indicating a more fleshy appearance.

Taiwan prefers black or darker colors for goat hair, so in 1999, the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute imported 100 bottles of frozen semen each from black and red Boer goats from the United States. Using artificial insemination, they began selecting and improving Boer goats with fewer white spots, and crossbred them with various colored goats to create large black meat goats like Boer goats, thereby improving the competitiveness of Taiwan's domestic industry.

Crossbreeding trials at the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute with Taiwan Black goats resulted in larger bodies and high reproductive performance in the first generation, with a conception rate of 70.6%, a birth rate of 171.0%, a twinning rate of up to 66.7%, a singleton rate of 25.0%, and a triplet rate of 8.3%. Crossbreeding of first-generation ewes from Nubian and Taiwan Black goats with Boer male goats resulted in a conception rate of 54.7%, a singleton rate of 22.3%, a twinning rate of 75.2%, and a birth rate of 179%.

The Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute conducted a cross-breeding experiment on Boer goats with various local goats at a diet of 15.8% crude protein and 65.3% total digestible nutrients. The results of the meat production were as follows: (1) Boer goats: daily weight gain 0.22kg, feed efficiency 5.9, slaughter rate 59.3%, lean meat rate 54.7%, fat 9.1%; (2) Taiwan Black goats × Boer goats: daily weight gain 0.17kg, feed efficiency 6.7, slaughter rate 54.7%, lean meat rate 55.9%, fat 8.3%; (3) Taiwan Black × Nubian × Boer goats: daily weight gain 0.21kg, feed efficiency 5.1, slaughter rate 56.9%, lean meat rate 55.8%, fat 9.5%.

The weight gain of any meat-producing livestock is influenced by factors such as environment and age. Purebred Boer goats in Australia typically gain significantly more weight than improved dairy goats currently available in Taiwan. Their average daily weight gain over a year is 0.20 kg when grazing, and can reach 0.25 kg when housed or in more intensively maintained conditions.

Boer goats also boast reproductive performance comparable to that of Nubian sheep. Their estrus cycle is 18-21 days, and their gestation period is 150 days, similar to that of other improved goats, but they estrus year-round, with no seasonal variations. Boer ewes mature at 24 months of age often give birth to twins or triplets, while first-time females are more likely to give birth to singletons or twins. Females can generally be bred as early as 7 months of age, but premature pregnancy and birthing can affect their growth and future fecundity. Therefore, breeding at 18 months of age, when they are first-time mothers, is most beneficial, as they can then expect to produce triplets. Boer goat milk has over twice the fat content of ordinary goats , resulting in exceptionally high-quality milk.

Taiwan Black Goats: Taiwan Black Goats refer to the black goats brought by our ancestors from China. They originally evolved with our ancestors in the western plains. Because of their small size, they were hybridized and improved with various imported improved goat breeds after 1900. In the first half of the century, they were mostly hybridized with the Saneng breed, and in the second half of the century, they were mostly hybridized and graded with the Nubian breed. The number of purebred Taiwan Black goats has greatly decreased, and most of the producers in the market are hybrids or graded breeds. In 1987, the few purebred Taiwan Black goats were listed as protected breed livestock, and are raised at the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute and the Hualien Breeding Farm respectively.

Taiwan Black goats have been subjected to long-term artificial reverse selection, where meat traders often select large goats for sale under the eaves of goat farmers. This has resulted in a gradual decrease in size of Taiwan Black goats, exacerbating the size difference between native and improved breeds. At the Miaoli Breeding Farm of the Animal Research Institute (Li, 1981), ewes give birth mostly between February and March. Through artificial natural breeding, they can produce two litters annually. The reproductive capacity of 30 ewes is as follows: 30 ewes, 27 breedings, resulting in a breeding rate of 90%. 24 farrowed, with a reproductive rate of 88.9%, a singleton rate of 79.2%, a twin rate of 20.8%, and an average litter size of 1.12. Birth weight is 1.4 kg for males and 1.0 kg for females. At one month of age, weaning weight is 2.4 kg for males and 2.1 kg for females. At two months of age, weaning weight is 5.9 kg for males and 5.0 kg for females. At three months of age, weaning weight is 8.8 kg for males and 8.4 kg for females. At four months of age, the weaning weight was 11.0 kg for males and 10.8 kg for females. At five months of age, the weaning weight was 16.1 kg for males and 13.0 kg for females. At six months of age, the weaning weight was 18.0 kg for males and 15.0 kg for females. At seven months of age, the weaning weight was 21.5 kg for males and 18.6 kg for females.

The original flock of Taiwan's native black goats, preserved and banked, was later transferred to the Hualien and Taitung branches of the Animal Research Institute for conservation and utilization. Numerous studies are underway on economic traits related to growth, reproduction, carcass, blood biochemicals, and nucleic acid polymorphism. A 2001 barn-feeding survey revealed birth weights of 2.7 kg for males and 2.6 kg for females. Three-month weaning weights were 13.7 kg for males and 11.9 kg for females. The dressing rate was 41.1%, with a lean meat percentage of 33.6%. The littering rate was 161.3%, the twinning rate was 54%, the average daily milk yield was 0.8 kg, and the milk fat percentage was 5.5%. Sixty frozen embryos were successfully produced, and the conception rate after transfer to ewes was 50%. At the Hualien Field of the Animal Research Institute, the average daily milk production during the first month after farrowing was 474±75 mL, the average milk production during the second month was 503±62 mL, and the average milk production during the third month was 274±95 mL (Zhuang et al., Hualien Field of the Animal Research Institute, 2005).

The Ji'an Goat in Development: Taiwanese people often use the saying "one black, two yellow, three spotted, four white..." when it comes to animal nutrition. In the mutton market, black goats are often fetched higher prices than other mixed colors. In 1998, the Hualien Breeding Farm of the Animal Research Institute, as part of its mutton improvement program, selected and purified superior all-black goats from the first generation of hybrids between Nubian and Native Black goats. This resulted in a new breed of Taiwanese black goats with rapid weight gain, excellent feed efficiency, and superior carcass traits. The results have been very successful (Wang et al., Hualien Farm of the Animal Research Institute, 2005). Therefore, the tentative name "Ji'an Goat" was proposed, named after its place of origin, Ji'an Township.

Hualien Changzhuang et al. (2005) at the Animal Research Institute selected superior first-generation hybrids of black sheep, which had a pure black coat ratio of 44%. Self-crossing of this first-generation hybrid resulted in an F2 with a black coat ratio of 6%, indicating that self-crossing of pure black sheep could produce pure black "Ji'an sheep." Ji'an sheep have a large head, ears that are neither large nor droopy, but rather slant outward, a slightly hooked nose, a well-defined jaw, a well-aligned bite, a slightly long neck, a moderately long mid-body, a deep body, a deep chest, and limbs that are not too long, giving them an overall brick-like appearance.

Wang et al. (2005) from the Animal Research Institute in Hualien conducted carcass analysis on four one-year-old rams and found that the slaughter rate was 56.92%, the bone rate was 10%, the lean meat rate was 42%, the fat rate was 8%, the viscera rate was 11.9%, and the weight was 3.875±39kg. Other major carcass traits were heavy.

The large size and excellent reproductive capacity of the imported Nubian dairy sheep from Ji'an were crossbred with local sheep to achieve a high litter size. The goal was to develop a new breed of sheep with a high litter size, so the lactation capacity of the sheep was investigated to assess its high reproductive potential. Milk production was collected twice daily from birth to three months of lactation. The results showed that the average daily milk production in the first month was 1,059 ± 77 mL; the average milk production in the second month was 1,029 ± 149 mL; and the average daily milk production in the third month was 738 ± 82 mL. The average daily milk production during these three months before weaning was 902 ± 233 mL (Hualien Changzhuang et al., Animal Research Institute, 2005). The average birth weight was 2.37 kg, and the weaning weight at 90 days of age (three months) was 12.79 kg, with an average daily weight gain of 0.115 kg.

Imported Black Belly Sheep: In May 1975, during a visit to the Republic of Barbados in Central and South America, President Yen Chia-kan received a gift of five Barbadian Black Belly sheep, two males and three females, from the King of Barbados. The sheep were handed over to President Yen and returned to Taiwan on May 18, 1975. Central and South America is a frequent area for foot-and-mouth disease, while Taiwan was considered free of the disease at the time. Therefore, after undergoing standard import quarantine and an additional three months of quarantine, the sheep were released. However, after repeated discussions, a conclusion remained undecided as to which unit of the Animal Research Institute should take care of them. One suggestion was that the Penghu Stock Breeding Center on an outlying island be responsible for the care. However, placing a gift from the King of Barbados on an outlying island would be contrary to international etiquette. After another three months of deliberation, and indeed more than six months of quarantine , the sheep were finally taken over by the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute.

The Barbadian Blackbelly sheep, derived from a cross between African shorthair sheep and European sheep, were introduced from West Africa by the Spanish and Portuguese in the 17th century and bred in the Caribbean and West Indies. They were established in the former British Barbados for 300 years. After Barbados gained independence in 1966 and became a member of the Commonwealth, these Blackbelly sheep were renamed Barbados sheep or Barbados Blackbelly sheep. In 1904, four females and one male Barbadian Blackbelly sheep were imported to the United States. The Barbadian Blackbelly sheep are well-suited to Taiwan's climate and have shown excellent growth and reproduction at the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute, earning them a worthy gift from the King. To accelerate the expansion of the herd, eight males and 38 females were imported from the United States in 1989 and 1992 , but their performance was found to be far inferior to that of the Barbadian Blackbelly sheep. Barbadian Blackbelly sheep have short wool and a brown-red body. Their chest, abdomen, underside, and inner limbs are black, with no markings or spots, hence the name. They are hornless, unlike American Blackbelly sheep, with males often having horns while females are hornless. They have large, flat ears, large eyes, and strong jaws. The male's nose is slightly hooked, while the female's is less pronounced. The forehead and nose bridge are lighter and whiter. Their necks are of moderate length, with the female's neck being thinner than the body, while the male's neck is thicker and blends smoothly into the shoulders. They have a broad body with well-developed ribs, a broad back and loin, a wide hindquarters, and a croup that slopes downward from the loin. Their tails are low-set and long, with a lobe extending to the hock. Barbadian Blackbelly sheep have excellent reproductive performance, with over half of their ewes bearing twins or more. A comparison of the reproductive performance of 132 Barbadian, 66 American, and 73 Barbadian-American hybrid black-bellied ewes at the Hengchun branch revealed the following results: Barbadian black-bellied sheep performed exceptionally well in Hengchun, demonstrating excellent reproductive potential, surpassing even American black-bellied sheep. Birth weights of Barbadian males (2.82±0.53 kg) and American-bred females (2.60±0.70 kg) were significantly different, while birth weights of Barbadian females (2.64±0.54 kg) and American-bred females (2.52±0.44 kg) were not significantly different. Similarly, weaning weights of Barbadian males (17.74±3.22 kg) and American-bred females (15.81±3.21 kg) were significantly different, but the difference between Barbadian females (15.37±3.16 kg and 14.27±3.30 kg) was not significant. Birth weight, weight at 6 months of age, and weight at 18 months of age of rams of Barbadian Blackbelly sheep selected at the Hengchun Branch in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995.

In a research project report by Wu et al. (1996) at the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute, seven six-month-old rams were subjected to forced fattening for four months on a 3:1 concentrate-to-roughage ratio, 13% crude protein (CP), and 68% total digestible nutrients (TDN). Their feed intake was recorded, but no significant differences were found between Barbary and American breeds. Four one-year-old fattened blackbelly sheep from each of these different strains were also selected for slaughter and carcass analysis. Carcass measurements of American blackbelly sheep revealed significantly better lean meat percentage, fat percentage, bone weight percentage, and skin weight ratio than Barbary blackbelly sheep, but no other significant differences were observed (Wu et al., Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute, 1996).

Taiwan's Blackbelly sheep have excellent reproductive stamina and robust growth and meat production, demonstrating the superiority of the Blackbelly sheep donated by Barbados. However, their tender, high-quality meat differs from the firmer goat meat favored in Taiwan. Despite their high productivity, their poor market acceptance and low price hindered their promotion. The Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute abandoned their breeding and promotion efforts, and most of them now remain on various leisure and tourism farms. Although Barbados is no longer a formal diplomatic ally of Taiwan, we should still be grateful and applauded for their gift of these valuable Barbadian national treasure meat livestock genetic resources.

The significance of identification: The means of livestock selection and improvement are nothing more than (1) body shape and appearance, (2) pedigree, and (3) performance testing. Advanced countries in developed countries have all enacted laws, such as the Livestock Improvement and Proliferation Act of the Animal Husbandry Act of our country (promulgated by the President in 1998). The central and local governments must actively promote the improvement and enhancement of livestock, master their genetic resources, and designate various breeding stock registration agencies to carry out pedigree registration, performance testing, and the improvement of livestock body shape and appearance. Obviously, the evaluation of body shape and appearance is one of the means of livestock breeding improvement. Although the purpose of raising meat sheep is not entirely to appreciate their appearance and body shape, but to appreciate their growth and meat production ability and rapid reproduction and reproduction ability, these growth and meat production and reproduction ability are comprehensive manifestations of the physiological functions of sheep. Physiological functions are inevitably unrelated to body structure. The content of this body structure is inevitably reflected in its shape and appearance, forming a form. This aligns with Hegel's (German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich HEGEL, 1770-1831) statement that "form is the form of its content, and content is the content of the form outside its behavior." In terms of livestock body type identification, this means that appearance symbolizes its physiological function. Therefore, in the selection and improvement of breeding sheep, the shape and appearance of a sheep can provide a glimpse into whether it will produce good meat. While carcass evaluation is certainly the most accurate method for identifying live animals, the appreciation of appearance during body type identification cannot be overlooked.

Meat sheep conformation is the classification, judging, and appearance of mutton. In developing countries, conformation is a complex process, serving both as an assessment of breed purity and an indicator of performance, making it one of the oldest and most primitive methods of selection. In developed countries, such as China's pig breeding registration system, where pedigree registration and performance testing are well-established, the conformation and appearance of breeding stock is a summary of their pedigree and performance testing results. This means that when selecting a breed, performance must be assessed based on performance testing results. To determine the heritability of these performance results, the pedigree must be examined. The performance of these tests is determined by examining the performance of the ancestral lineage over generations, all of which are recorded on paper. Finally, visual inspection and appearance assessment are necessary to summarize the pedigree and testing results. Before the establishment of a breeding sheep registration system in China, sheep farmers primarily relied on conformation and appearance assessment as the sole selection method. Appearance assessment is the most effective method for determining breed characteristics and assessing breed purity. Furthermore, identifying the body shape and appearance of meat sheep can improve their body type. For example, when improving the Nubian dairy breed to focus on domestic use in China, their body shape has shifted away from dairy production and towards a more boxy meat-producing body shape. Improving functional body shape not only improves the skeletal structure of meat sheep, as the length and width of the mid-quarters and hindquarters are related to meat yield, but also enhances milk production and reproductive performance. Improving the appearance of feet and hooves can affect longevity. Therefore, without a comprehensive pedigree registration and performance testing system, the only way to actively improve meat sheep is to strengthen the identification of the body shape and appearance of breeding sheep.

When identifying body type, the first thing to consider is whether the body type is specific to its intended use. Meat sheep must possess the characteristics of meat sheep, as centuries of livestock breeding have resulted in a body shape that reflects its intended use. This is especially true when combined with the successive generations of registered and improved pedigrees, resulting in a body type that is consistently tailored to the intended use. Like beef cattle or pigs, meat sheep have a sturdy, rectangular, cylindrical body, with a well-developed forequarters and a substantial, well-proportioned, rectangular or blocky hindquarters. Their limbs are appropriately short and muscular, with distinct, clean tendons and no excess. Secondly, attention should be paid to the varying characteristics and gender characteristics of breeds with the same intended use. The simplest way to identify body type is through gender, with differences between males and females. Males should resemble males, with a large, deep forechest that is heavier than the hindquarters. Females, on the other hand, have a deeper mid-quarters, heavier hindquarters than the forequarters, and are more docile and peaceful.

Although breeds share the same purpose, their distinct characteristics are derived from the physical appearance standards established by the respective registration associations at the time of their establishment. When registering pedigrees with each breed registration association, sheep farmers must follow the registration procedures of each registration association to select and maintain the purity of the breed, physical appearance, and performance improvements. Therefore, each sheep must be reviewed item by item according to the physical appearance standards established by the registration association. The review standards are based on the average of the body measurements of existing sheep, incorporating desired body parts to achieve the ideal body shape. The names of the various body parts of meat sheep must be known before effective body identification.

When registering breeding sheep in Taiwan, the body type and appearance criteria and scoring tables used to identify meat sheep require an understanding of the current physique and average size of the sheep. The ideal type (true type) is then determined based on the current body type and weight, and these are then compared and identified. For example, Nubian sheep, bred for dairy production in Europe and the United States, have been bred over centuries to develop a body type suited for dairy production. However, in Taiwan, the focus has shifted from dairy production to a meat-producing body type similar to the Boer. Therefore, the body type and appearance criteria are divided into two distinct standards for dairy and meat production. The results of selecting and improving body types based on specific uses are significant.

China's sheep breeding registration system divides the physical appearance of meat sheep into seven major scoring areas. A 30- point score for general appearance assesses overall symmetry and conformity to the functional body characteristics of meat sheep. This is further subdivided into forequarters, midquarters, and hindquarters, providing detailed identification of each meat-producing part. The forequarters is the area from the shoulder (the back edge of the foreleg) to the front chest and neck. The hindquarters is the area from the loin (the front edge of the hindleg) to the back, including the buttocks. The midquarters is the area from the front edge of the hindleg and the ribs to the back edge of the foreleg, excluding the forequarters and hindquarters. These important body parts should be broad, wide, and voluminous, with a straight, strong back and a flat, narrow, and nearly parallel backline. The head and neck are the most effective parts for identifying breed characteristics and are a valuable tool for determining the purity or hybridization of a breed, but they are rarely effective in assessing meat production. The strength of the feet and hooves plays a crucial role in a breed's longevity. The feet of meat-producing animals shouldn't be too thick or too long, as overly large bones will increase the bone-to-meat ratio after slaughter and reduce the lean meat content. However, the purpose of selecting a breed of sheep is to improve its offspring, ensuring each successive generation is superior. However, a good sheep must have a good body shape, so the limbs of a particular breed shouldn't be too short, as this would negate its purpose. Therefore, they should be neither too long nor too long, but rather of appropriate length. The last component is the skin and coat. Although this is the least important component to consider, the skin should be thin, not thick, and soft, and the coat should be fine, bright, and lustrous. This reflects the breed's physical and mental state, and also reflects the quality of its husbandry and management. Coat color is also a valuable indicator of breed identification.

When inspecting and identifying the body shape and appearance, first observe the general appearance of the whole sheep from a distance of 1-2 meters to get an overall impression, compare them with each other, and identify the upper, middle and lower ranking. Continue to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each part of the body, and the stance and pace of the feet and hooves. Finally, use the head and fur to assess the breed characteristics. If there are any that do not meet the standards set by the breeding sheep registration regulations, they should be identified as disqualified and not scored, or they should be punished as the lowest and not be registered as breeding sheep. In this way, the inspection is completed.

Auction and Competition: Carnivals that showcase and promote various agricultural products are often held across China. These primarily feature exhibitions and auctions, often lacking competitions, exchanges, or spectatorships. In fact, the essence of agricultural product or livestock carnivals (shows; fairs) lies in the fact that breeders and breeders from all over the country participate in these auctions and competitions, which have a significant impact on the nation's breeding stock. Therefore, Japan calls these competitions, exchanges, and auctions "Kyojinkai," which are clearly defined as carnivals for the joint improvement of breeding stock. The methods for improving livestock breeding are primarily based on (1) bloodline, (2) performance, and (3) appearance. In 1662, four centuries ago, the Royal Society was established in the United Kingdom to advocate the importance of studying natural sciences. A century before the establishment of the livestock pedigree registration system in 1775, improvements to the body shape and appearance of livestock were implemented, and livestock competitions were established. In 1838, the Royal Agricultural Society of England was established to host the annual Royal Livestock Show. Therefore, the improvement process of modern livestock breeding is actually the order of (1) appearance, (2) pedigree, and (3) performance testing. Knowing the improvement of appearance is an indispensable means. In 1908, Taiwan held its first pig breeding competition (Tongjinhui) in Tainan City. In 1911, the first national poultry competition was also held in Tainan City. Afterwards, an annual competition system for various livestock was established. This livestock breeding and improvement method was maintained during the provincial government era after World War II. Each year, different counties and cities would cooperate with farmers' associations or various industry associations to host national competitions. Unfortunately, after the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) broke out in 1997, all livestock competition systems were abolished, severely damaging the integrity of the livestock breeding and improvement strategy.

After taking over the management of Taiwan's breeding sheep registration from the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, the Central Livestock Association recognized the importance of competitions, exchanges, and auctions for improving breeder appearance beyond pedigree registration and performance testing. The association actively provides participating sheep farmers with opportunities to participate in these competitions, exchanges, and auctions, allowing them to showcase and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their sheep's body shapes. In 2004 , the Sheep Breeding Association and the Central Livestock Association jointly hosted the first annual breeding sheep competition, exchanges, and auctions in Baihe Township, Tainan County, using the Baihe Pig Association's competition and auction venue. A similar competition, held at the same Baihe venue on November 30, 2005 , was held . This annual event provides opportunities for farmers to discuss and discuss breeding trends, fostering future aspirations and aspirations. The quality of meat sheep is easier to accurately assess based on their appearance than that of dairy sheep. Therefore, it is crucial to gather outstanding breeders from all over the country that meet the registered breeder standards. This allows for mutual observation, comparison, and exchange of opinions, fostering community recognition and unifying improvement goals to achieve educational objectives. The competition is divided into groups based on breed and size. Expert judges and judges appointed by the organizer determine the rankings. The results are then briefly reviewed and auctioned off, fostering the exchange and rapid dissemination of superior genetics.

Goat activity level: Goats are more active and lively than sheep, and their energy consumption increases. Therefore, the energy requirements of goats vary greatly with the breeding environment.

Goat Feed Intake: Growing and lactating sheep consume approximately 3.5-5.0% of their body weight in dry matter per day, while dairy cows and sheep consume only 2.5-3.0% of their body weight. Given the relationship between feed intake and body weight, goats can consume large amounts of low-quality forage to compensate for their nutritional deficiencies. Similarly, if their feed intake is limited, goats require a higher nutrient concentration than other ruminants.

Goat Chyme Transmission Rate: Goats have a smaller rumen-to-bodyweight ratio, and because they eat more, their chyme remains in the rumen faster than sheep and cattle. However, goats still digest nutrients more efficiently than other ruminants. This is due to the presence of a larger population of rumen microorganisms. In particular, when fed low-quality forage, goats have higher concentrations of fiber-degrading bacteria in their rumen fluid than sheep. Therefore, studying the nutritional requirements of goats cannot be completely applied to other ruminants. However, research on some nutrients in goats is lacking, leading some scholars to suggest that recommended nutrient amounts for goats can be based on those for sheep.

Energy: Energy can be used for the maintenance, growth, reproduction, lactation, fur growth and activity of the goat's body. The energy source required by the goat's body comes from carbohydrates and fats, and only a small part may be derived from the catabolism of protein. Carbohydrates and fats account for 60-70% of the total energy of the feed, and they are converted into volatile fatty acids (mainly acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid) through fermentation, and then absorbed through the rumen wall to provide energy. The efficiency of nutrient utilization depends on whether the energy supply is sufficient, which is an important key to goat production. The range of energy requirements of goats is the largest among all livestock. This is related to the fact that there are many types of goats, production purposes (wool, meat and milk) and activity levels.

Take, for example, sheep are docile, while goats are more active and roam more freely, often digging under fences. This is the so-called "smart goats, tired sheep." Goats also have a "height-loving nature"—they enjoy climbing and jumping, which requires them to expend more energy. Goats kept in barns do not require increased energy maintenance; however, goats grazed in intensive conditions or in hot climates require a 25% increase in energy maintenance. Goats grazed in semi-arid areas and on small hills require a 50% increase in energy maintenance. Goats grazed on sparse grasslands, coarse rocks, and seasonal mountain grazing require a 75% increase in energy maintenance. Mountain grazing is particularly energy-intensive, leading to the saying among herders in mainland China that "once you've been to the mountains, you won't be able to recover for three days." Taiwan's goat farmers all raise lactating goats in barns. Although they do not consider the increase in maintenance energy due to activity, the energy needs of dairy goats are affected by age, body shape, growth, pregnancy and lactation. Therefore, the energy provided to dairy goats must be adjusted according to the pregnancy stage and milk production to stably meet the energy needs of dairy goats.

to provide adequate energy intake before breeding, during breeding, and two months before farrowing. Energy supply should be increased in dairy goats during the two months before farrowing and during lactation. Goat maintenance energy is often expressed in terms of digestible energy ( DE ) . In 1981 , the National Research Council (NRC) estimated the energy requirement for ewes during the final two months of pregnancy to be 1.74 Mcal/DE . However, this energy level is difficult for most goats, especially small goats. The energy requirement for small and medium-sized goats carrying a single litter is only 0.87 Mcal/DE . Some scholars believe that the NRC 's energy requirement for pregnant ewes is tailored to large goats carrying multiple litters.

Energy deficiency not only stunts goat growth, delays puberty, and reduces fertility, but also affects milk production. Sustained energy deficiency reduces goat resistance to infectious diseases and parasites. Adequate energy supply is particularly crucial for pregnant and lactating goats. Pregnancy toxemia, also known as ketosis, is a nutritional and metabolic disorder that often occurs in late pregnancy due to insufficient energy intake. The fetus develops rapidly during the last week of pregnancy. For example, in Alpine goats, weight gain is 1.5 kg/week. During this period, the fetus requires more energy and glucose. If the dry matter or energy intake of a ewe is insufficient, the ewe will increase lipid activity, i.e., the catabolism of adipose tissue. This involves breaking down stored fat and converting it into gluconeogenesis, which provides a source of energy. This results in an increase in plasma ketone bodies (e.g., acetone). If energy intake continues to be insufficient after parturition, the ewe's body will accumulate excessive ketones, leading to ketosis. Exercise can help reduce ketosis, which may seem unbelievable because it increases the goat's energy needs. However, exercise actually causes muscle contraction, which accelerates the utilization of ketone bodies and the release of lactic acid, a precursor to gluconeogenesis.

Energy intake is the primary factor influencing milk production. Energy deficiency can lead to a rapid decrease in milk production in dairy goats. If a goat receives only 85% of its total energy requirement, milk production will decrease within one to two days. However, energy intake in early lactation has less impact on milk production than in mid-lactation, as goats utilize stored energy to produce milk. High-yielding goats can produce 0.5-1.0 kg of 4% fat-corrected milk using their stored energy .

Energy insufficiency is more common in dairy goats during the late stages of pregnancy. This is due to a decrease in appetite and the continued rapid growth of the fetus, which compresses the rumen volume, leading to a decrease in feed intake. Therefore, feeding strategies during this period should include providing high-quality, palatable roughage to maintain rumen volume and prevent energy insufficiency. International studies have found that compared to goats fed high-quality forage, feed intake and milk production decreased by approximately 70% (1.1 vs. 1.9 kg DM/day) in dairy goats fed low-quality forage, but milk production decreased by approximately 90% (1.0 vs. 1.9 kg/day). Therefore, feeding dairy goats high-quality forage increases their feed intake and, consequently, milk production. Although it is necessary to try to meet the energy needs of dairy goats in the late pregnancy, it is not advisable to make them too obese, because lipids will accumulate in the abdominal cavity and relatively reduce the volume of the rumen, resulting in a decrease in their feed intake. At the same time, it will also put dairy goats at risk of developing pregnancy toxemia.

Because dairy goats' maximum dry matter intake occurs during peak lactation, the key to high-yield dairy goats lies in nutritionally providing them with the necessary nutrients from parturition to peak lactation. Goats' feed intake can increase by 30-40% one week after parturition, reaching peak lactation 6-10 weeks later. When supplementing energy during lactation, the timing of adding large amounts of concentrate is crucial. Providing large amounts of concentrate in late pregnancy and early lactation yields the best milk production and economic benefits, as a high concentration of concentrate in early lactation improves milk production more than during mid- and late lactation. Providing grain helps maintain peak lactation, but grain processing is not essential to improve goats' digestibility and milk production. Goats fed whole grain produce milk equivalent to those fed grain. Feeding goats powdered grain results in lower milk fat content than goats fed whole grain.

When it comes to providing forage for lactating goats, green grass is preferred over hay and silage. In a mild climate, dairy goats can maintain and produce 1-2.5 kg of milk with an ad libitum diet of hay and silage. A free diet of green grass can produce 2-3 kg of milk. Although Taiwan's hot and humid summers are ideal for grass growth, autumn enters a dry season with little rain, and the southern region lacks sufficient green grass for goats. Once goats become accustomed to their forage, they can become picky eaters. For example, if they are fed green grass or hay, they will refuse to eat, gradually becoming emaciated. Therefore, the Complete Book of Agricultural Administration states that pens should always be kept clean. Do not feed green grass throughout the year, as doing so will cause them to lose weight and become refusing to eat dry grass. Therefore, goat farmers should preferably feed lactating goats with hay or silage.

Water: Water is essential for goats' metabolism and is therefore crucial for their growth. The water content of a goat's body varies with age and body fat content. The average goat's body water content is over 60%. Sheep are domestic animals that dislike drinking water. Some tropical breeds can go for long periods without water, earning them the nickname "water horses and drought sheep." Goats drink even less water than sheep. Comparing water consumption with cattle, a normal goat consumes 1.4-1.7 kg of water for every kg of dry matter consumed, while cattle consume 2.1 kg of water for every kg of dry matter consumed. This indicates that goats have the highest water utilization efficiency of all livestock, comparable to camels.
There are three main reasons why goats require less water than other livestock: (1) Goats cannot withstand the rigors of high temperatures, unlike sheep or cattle, which require large amounts of water to evaporate to control their body temperature. (2) Goats can reduce the water content of their urine and feces to conserve water. (3) Goats' rumens can store large amounts of water ( for example, the black Bedouin goat stores 40% of its body weight in water ) , so goats can tolerate 2-4 days without drinking water and still produce a satisfactory amount of milk.
The daily water requirement of goats is related to their feed intake. The formula for water intake is: total water intake = (3.86 - dry matter intake ) - 0.99 or total water intake (g/kg BW0.75) = 2.98 dry matter intake (g/kg BW0.75 + 0.854% dry matter). The latter formula does not apply to fodder with a dry matter content of less than 20% . When the dry matter content of the fodder is less than 30% , goats can meet their water needs without drinking water. However, in fact, goats will still drink water if water is provided. From the above formula, we know that if a sheep consumes about 1kg of dry matter, its water intake is 2-3kg. Factors that influence goats' water intake include milk production, ambient temperature, moisture content of forage, exercise, and the salt and mineral content of the feed. Water cleanliness and temperature also affect the amount of water a goat drinks, so lactating goats need clean, fresh water. Lactating goats require 1-4 gallons of water per day, plus an additional 2.5 quarts of water for lactation. In temperate regions, the maintenance water requirement for lactating goats is 145.6g/kg 0.75 , and an additional 1.43kg of water is needed for every kg of milk produced .

If lactating sheep do not drink enough water, their milk production will decrease. Non-lactating sheep, if they have access to juicy grass or graze on juicy pastures, will consume very little water, generally only every other day, and do not need to drink much during the fattening period. Mainland Chinese scholars point out that sheepherders should "avoid hasty movement, thirst, and frequent drinking. They should be driven well, moving between areas with trees and grass near water, and drink a full drink every other day." Bu Shi, a Han Dynasty sheepherder, observed: "Drink only once every two days; frequent drinking can cause water loss and nasal discharge." Water drinking precautions for sheep include avoiding hasty movement, as drinking before catching your breath or drinking too quickly can easily lead to choking and pneumonia, commonly known as "exploded lungs."
Protein: Protein is a major component of the goat's body. It can be obtained from feed and, after digestion and absorption, is used for tissue and organ development, cell repair, secretion of digestive enzymes and endocrine hormones, fetal growth, and lactation. While protein supplementation in mid-lactation has little effect on milk production, in early lactation, high-yielding goats, in particular, are more sensitive to dietary protein. Increasing the digestible crude protein content of concentrate from 12.5% to 18.5% increases fat-corrected milk production by 5-10%. To produce 2.5 kg of fat-corrected milk in mid-lactation, a goat can maintain production on a diet containing 16% crude protein (CP). In late lactation, goats only need a diet containing 10% crude protein. Protein requirements for goats are often expressed in terms of digestible protein (DP). The daily protein requirement for all pregnant goats in the two months before farrowing is 57 g DP; during lactation, this requirement is 51 g DP/kg of 4% fat-corrected milk. Microorganisms convert organic matter and decomposed nitrogen in the rumen into microbial protein, which then passes through the abomasum and is digested into amino acids, ultimately forming the animal's protein. Feeding ruminants with urea as a nitrogen source for microorganisms can save on feed protein. However, different nitrogen sources affect the conversion of digestible nitrogen into milk nitrogen. Studies have shown that, given the same amount of digestible nitrogen, goats fed a diet of soybean meal and urea have a lower efficiency in converting nitrogen into milk (0.53 vs. 0.72) than goats fed a diet of soybean meal and fish meal .

Although dietary protein is an essential nutrient for lactating goats, increasing dietary protein content is not beneficial for ruminants. This is because high dietary protein levels increase rumen ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentrations, preventing rumen microbial utilization and leading to excretion in the urine. Consequently, international studies have shown that reducing dietary CP from 18% to 16% can improve feed efficiency in goats aged 103 to 156 days. Dietary protein that can be broken down by microorganisms in the rumen is called rumen-degradable protein (RDP), with approximately 9 g of RDP requiring 0.24 Mcal of energy. Protein that cannot be broken down by microorganisms is called rumen-undegraded protein (UDP). To prevent the loss of ammonia nitrogen and energy from rumen microbial degradation of dietary protein, formaldehyde treatment can be used to preserve dietary protein. For example, feeding ground nuts treated with formaldehyde to goats can increase their growth rate and improve feed efficiency. For dairy goats with high milk production, additional UDP is needed.

Calcium and phosphorus: Calcium and phosphorus are key minerals that should be considered in goat feed formulations. A deficiency of either or both in young animals can lead to poor growth and poor bone shape (cartilage). In adult animals, calcium is particularly important for lactating goats, as goat milk is rich in calcium. The calcium and phosphorus requirements of lactating goats increase during production, particularly during growth and lactation. The recommended daily intakes for a 55kg lactating goat during maintenance are 3.7g and 2.5g, respectively. During pregnancy, these intakes are 3.7-7.9g and 2.5-3.6g, respectively. During lactation, the recommended daily intakes for 1kg/day of milk production are 7.9g and 4.0g, respectively. For every additional 1kg/day of milk production, the recommended intakes increase by 4.2g and 1.5g, respectively.

Excessive calcium intake does not pose an immediate danger to goats, but it can interfere with absorption and cause deficiencies in phosphorus and certain divalent cations (magnesium and manganese). Although fewer goats are affected by low phosphorus, the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in the diet is crucial. Therefore, when supplementing goat diets with minerals, attention should be paid to the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. The ideal ratio is between 1.2:1 and 2.5:1. However, ruminants can tolerate a calcium-to-phosphorus ratio of 7:1. During pregnancy and early lactation, severe calcium-to-phosphorus imbalances in goats can lead to lactation fever. High-yielding lactating goats are susceptible to lactation fever due to hypocalcemia. Normal blood calcium concentrations in ewes range from 9-10.5 mg/dL; in lactating goats, this condition can drop to as low as 5 mg/dL. This condition is related to dietary calcium content, but parathyroid hormone also plays a role, as it releases free calcium from bones. Impaired parathyroid hormone secretion can lead to hypocalcemia in goats. This disease can be treated with grape calcium, intravenous injection. In male goats, if calcium and phosphorus imbalance occurs (low ratio below 1:1), that is, the phosphorus content is too high, it will lead to urinary tract stones or kidney stones.

Most forages are a good source of dietary calcium but are very low in phosphorus. Therefore, goats grazing on phosphorus-deficient pastures can easily develop phosphorus deficiencies. Legumes are excellent sources of calcium. To prevent nutritional deficiencies in goats caused by calcium and phosphorus deficiency or imbalance, calcium and phosphorus supplementation is necessary. To compensate for calcium deficiencies, limestone powder is commonly used and allowed to feed ad libitum. To compensate for phosphorus deficiencies, monosodium phosphate , disodium phosphate, or feed-grade phosphoric acid can be provided. To supplement both calcium and phosphorus, commonly used supplements include dicalcium phosphate , defluorinated calcium phosphate , and steamed bone meal.

Why sheep prefer salt: A saying in mainland China goes, "Sheep naturally love salt, and they find it most beneficial to eat salt." This suggests that sheep enjoy salt, and providing them with sufficient salt is beneficial to their growth. The salt mentioned here includes both chloride and sodium. Sheep consume more salt per kilogram of body weight than cattle. Another saying goes, "If you don't eat salt in spring, you won't have a good summer; if you don't eat in the dog days of summer, you won't eat grass." This means that insufficient salt intake in spring hinders growth, and in the hot summer, the need for salt is even greater. If sheep are unable to absorb salt, their appetite is affected, and they will not eat grass. Sheep prefer salt because forage grass contains too little sodium, comprising only 0.05-0.15% of the daily diet, far from meeting their physiological needs.

Salt is important to sheep: Sodium maintains osmotic pressure within the body's cells, facilitating the transfer of nutrients and waste; while chloride is essential for maintaining gastric acid secretion in the abomasum (the fourth stomach of ruminants). Chronic salt deficiency in sheep can lead to a bland taste in the mouth, a loss of appetite, lethargy, decreased nutrient utilization, and poor growth. Sheep are also prone to pica, a habit characterized by chewing wood, wool, and soil. To satisfy their craving for salt, they often lick dirt and eat poisonous plants.

Salt Addition: Salt or saltiness can be used in animal husbandry as a means of regulating appetite and preventing disease. Adding salt powder to goats in spring can prevent disease and help them grow fatter. The recommended daily sodium intake for goats should be 0.5-1.0% of the total diet . For dairy goats weighing 55 kg , the recommended daily sodium intake is 1 gram for maintenance, 1 gram for the first three months of pregnancy , and 1.2 grams for the two months before farrowing . During lactation , the recommended sodium intake is 1.5 grams for maintenance and lactation, and 0.5 grams for every additional 1 kg of lactation per day . When salt is added to a mixture feed , it is usually added at 0.5% salt to a complete ration or 1 % salt to a concentrate . However, not all grazing sheep require salt supplementation. For example, water sources in alkaline soil areas of the western United States may already contain sufficient salt to meet the needs of sheep, so salt supplementation is not necessary.

Salt is used to control goat feed intake: When salt is used to limit the amount of supplements (concentrates) that goats can freely consume, provided sufficient fresh, cold water is provided, the proportion of salt in the mixture depends on the goat's feed consumption, typically ranging from 10-15% to as much as 50%. Mineral salts containing trace elements should not be used in this manner, as they may cause copper poisoning. For goats, it is best to allow them to feed freely. Enterotoxemia is a major disease in goats in Taiwan, with a high mortality rate (up to 86%). One of the causes is that confined sheep consume more concentrates and less roughage, which leads to impaired digestion and a higher susceptibility to disease. When feeding concentrates to goats, increasing the salt content to reduce overconsumption of concentrates should reduce the incidence of enterotoxemia.

Salt feeding methods: (1) Salt powder: The Complete Book of Agricultural Administration records the method of raising sheep with salt: "One liter of salt should be placed in a clay pot and hung in the sheep pen. The sheep like salt and will come back to eat it on their own, so there is no need for human shepherding." The method of feeding with salt powder in mainland China is to sprinkle salt powder thinly on bricks and stones, let the sheep eat it when they come in and out, or mix it with grass and feed it. (2) Salt brick feeding: The salt brick feeding method is to place salt bricks in the pen for the sheep to eat. In the early days, Taiwanese sheep farmers imported salt bricks from abroad, which were expensive. Now domestic salt factories also produce salt bricks, but the price is cheaper.

When feeding salt to sheep, there are some things to be aware of: (1) Damage to teeth: When providing edible salt, it is best to use loose salt rather than block salt. This is because sheep prefer to bite rather than lick salt from block salt. Salt blocks are very dry and hard in the wild, so excessive force can easily break their teeth. (2) Excessive salt intake in goats: When salt is provided to goats and they are allowed to explore freely, they will consume more than they need. If they are provided with sufficient drinking water, this will not cause any disease to the goats.

Magnesium: Magnesium is a component of bone, accounting for 60-70% of total magnesium, while soft tissues and extracellular fluids contribute 30-40%. Magnesium plays a crucial role in neuromuscular activity, requiring magnesium ions to activate many enzyme systems involved in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Magnesium deficiency can lead to grass tetany, leg stiffness, and head retraction in animals. High potassium levels in the diet can negatively impact goats' magnesium utilization. Vigorously growing grass contains high levels of potassium, so goats grazing juicy, green pastures or winter grain pastures fertilized with nitrogen and potassium are more susceptible to magnesium deficiency. The recommended daily intake of magnesium for lactating goats is 1g, including 1.0g and 1.2g before and during late pregnancy, respectively. During lactation, the recommended daily intake is 1.70g for every kg of milk produced per day. For every additional kg of milk produced per day, the recommended intake should be increased by 0.7g. Because forage grasses contain high levels of nitrogen and potassium, the minimum amount of magnesium that should be added to goat diets is 0.22%. However, there is a lack of literature on whether excessive magnesium levels can cause poisoning in goats.

Potassium: The primary electrolyte within cells is potassium, while the primary electrolyte outside cells is sodium. Potassium influences intracellular osmotic pressure and acid-base balance. Potassium also activates enzyme systems involved in energy transfer and utilization, protein synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism. Goats fed a basic roughage diet provide sufficient potassium for their needs. Potassium absorption occurs throughout the digestive tract. Potassium deficiency reduces feed intake, stunted growth, and reduced milk production. Severe deficiency symptoms include emaciation and poor muscle tone. The recommended potassium content in goat diets is 0.8%. The recommended daily intake for a lactating goat weighing 55 kg is 3.1 g, including 3.1-3.4 g during pregnancy. During lactation, the recommended daily intake is 2.3 g for every additional kg/day of milk production.

Sulfur: Sulfur is an important component of sulfur-containing amino acids ( methionine and cystine ) . Goat hair is particularly high in sulfur. If non-albuminate nitrogen is used as a protein source in goat diets, additional sulfur should be added. Rumen microorganisms can incorporate the added sulfur into protein. Elemental sulfur or sulfate can be used as sulfur supplements. If urea or other non-albuminate nitrogen sources are used in the diet, the sulfur to nitrogen ratio should be 1:10 . Goats also have an increased need for sulfur when they consume plants containing tannins. Symptoms of sulfur deficiency in goats include decreased appetite, weight loss, poor growth, and decreased milk production.

Cobalt: Cobalt is an essential element for the synthesis of vitamin B12 and is essential for the growth and development of goats. Symptoms of cobalt deficiency in goats include weight loss, poor appetite, weakness, and anemia. While sheep can meet their cobalt needs with a cobalt intake of 0.1 ppm , goats' cobalt requirements are believed to be similar to those of sheep. Goats should be fed cobalt regularly, ideally daily. Cobalt should be added to salt bricks at a rate of 5.45 g per 100 lbs . and allowed to freely explore the food.

Copper and Molybdenum: Copper is absorbed primarily in the small intestine, though the stomach and large intestine also absorb it. Excess copper is stored in the liver. Copper is an essential mineral for the biochemical synthesis of hemoglobin and red blood cell maturation. Copper is also a key component or activator of many enzymes . Symptoms of copper deficiency in lambs include muscle weakness, ataxia, and frequent recumbency. Symptoms of copper deficiency in adult goats include anemia, changes in coat color, and fertility impairment. Copper and molybdenum are interrelated in animal metabolism, so molybdenum should be considered when evaluating goats' copper needs. High levels of molybdenum in the diet can cause copper excretion from the animal, leading to copper deficiency. Therefore, additional copper supplementation is necessary. Sheep are sensitive to copper, and excessive copper consumption can lead to copper poisoning. Whether goats suffer from copper poisoning in the same way as sheep has not yet been reported. Molybdenum is found in the highest concentrations in the bones, liver, and kidneys of animals. Molybdenum is a component of many enzymes , such as xanthine oxidase , xanthine dehydrogenase , and nitrate reductase . Molybdenum is primarily involved in the formation of uric acid and the catabolism of nitrates. Molybdenum is absorbed primarily in the small intestine and excreted via feces, but less frequently through urine. While molybdenum deficiency rarely occurs in goats in the wild, as it does in cattle and sheep, studies have shown that molybdenum deficiency can lead to slowed growth, reduced conception rates, and increased miscarriage.

Fluoride: Small doses help strengthen bones and teeth, but excessive amounts can soften bones and cause tooth spots and wear. Fluoride deficiency rarely occurs in goats, but excess fluoride can be toxic. Fluoride poisoning in sheep occurs at dietary concentrations exceeding 200 ppm, and the doses for goats are similar.

Iodine: The thyroid gland contains 70-80% of the body's total iodine, the highest concentration of iodine among animal tissues and organs. Iodine is an essential mineral for the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine. Consuming an iodine-deficient diet can cause thyroid enlargement. Iodine can affect the basal metabolism and fertilization rate of adult goats. Iodine can also affect cell differentiation, growth, and development in fetuses and young goats. Consequently, iodine deficiency can lead to birth weakness or even death in lambs. Iodine deficiency is widespread worldwide. To prevent iodine deficiency in goats, feed them iodized salt. Ruminants absorb iodine primarily in the rumen, with less absorption occurring in the small intestine. However, overfeeding goats with iodized salt to achieve a restricted diet is unwise, as it may lead to excessive iodine intake. The maximum iodine tolerance of sheep is 45 ppm, and goats tolerate similar levels of iodine.

Iron: Iron is a component of hemoglobin. Iron deficiency rarely occurs in mature grazing goats, but it is more common in lambs. This is because newborn goats have low body iron stores, and the milk they consume also contains low iron. If the deficiency is caused by lamb milk, iron supplementation can be achieved by intramuscular injection of 150 mg of iron-dextran every two to three weeks, or by adding ferrous sulfate or ferric citrate to the diet .

Manganese: Manganese is an essential mineral for goat bone development and reproduction. Feeding goats a diet low in manganese, such as corn and sorghum, increases the likelihood of manganese deficiency. Symptoms of manganese deficiency in goats include reluctance to walk, forelimb defects, delayed estrus, difficulty conceiving, abortion, and a 20% reduction in birth weight. While manganese can be absorbed throughout the small intestine, only 1-4% of the dietary manganese is absorbed. Ruminants cannot effectively store manganese.

Zinc: Zinc is an essential mineral for goats, known for its role in the growth and regeneration of skin and hair. Symptoms of zinc deficiency in goats include decreased feed intake, weight loss, joint stiffness, excessive salivation, swollen feet, small testicles, and decreased libido. To alleviate zinc deficiency, zinc should be continuously added to the diet. Zinc absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine, leaving little available for use in the body. The zinc requirement for goats is 10 ppm , and the toxic dose is 1000 ppm .

Selenium: Although selenium is an essential mineral for goats, the requirement is very low. Glutathione peroxidase contains selenium. Selenium and vitamin E interact, reducing the need for each. Selenium levels as low as 0.04 mg per kilogram of dry matter in the diet can cause selenium deficiency in pregnant and lactating goats. Selenium deficiency in goats from birth to several months of age can lead to white muscle disease, which can cause sudden death or muscle paralysis, particularly stiffness of the hind limbs and an inability to lift them. Selenium is excreted in milk and stored in the fur. Like other livestock, goats are susceptible to selenium poisoning. The recommended dose for selenium poisoning in goats is generally 3 ppm , the same as for sheep . Symptoms of selenium poisoning in goats include loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, constipation followed by diarrhea, excessive thirst ( polydipsia ), polyuria, difficulty breathing, and a low rectal temperature. Excessive selenium can also cause hoof pain and loss.

Vitamin A: Goat forage does not contain vitamin A, but it does contain its precursor, beta-carotene. Approximately 1 gram of beta-carotene is equivalent to 400 IU of vitamin A. Animals primarily absorb vitamin A in the anterior small intestine, and the liver is the body's primary vitamin A storage organ, accounting for approximately 75-90% of total storage.

Vitamin A's functions include: 1. Maintaining normal vision: Vitamin A is essential for the formation and regeneration of rhodopsin pigment in the eyes. Therefore, vitamin A deficiency in goats can lead to night blindness, or even blindness in severe cases. 2. Maintaining normal tissue function: Vitamin A deficiency causes epithelial keratinization of cells in the respiratory, intestinal, reproductive, and urinary tracts, as well as the eyes. 3. Strengthening immunity: Vitamin A deficiency can make goats susceptible to disease and parasites, leading to poor reproductive performance.

There are two main causes of vitamin A deficiency in goats. The primary one is insufficient vitamin A in the diet , particularly during the dry season or winter due to limited grass availability, or poor quality hay fed to goats, such as prolonged or improper hay storage, which can lead to sun and rain exposure. During hay production, poor weather can cause the loss of nutrients from hay due to rain, or prolonged exposure to the sun, which destroys nutrients, can also contribute. Another contributing factor is that the lambs' bodies do not store sufficient vitamin A. Vitamin A supplementation can be achieved by adding vitamin A to the diet , providing ample grass and corn, and administering slow-release intramuscular vitamin A injections. However, it should be noted that vitamin A utilization efficiency does not increase with increasing vitamin A intake.

Vitamin D: Sun-dried forage is rich in vitamin D. Vitamin D is involved in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, thus affecting their deposition and reabsorption in bones, and also affecting their excretion. An imbalance in dietary calcium and phosphorus increases the physiological requirement for vitamin D. Lambs raised in sheds without adequate sunlight should receive vitamin D supplementation. Oral vitamin D is absorbed in the small intestine. For goats, vitamin D has the same effects as vitamin D. Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency include skeletal abnormalities, including rickets and growth retardation.

Vitamin E : Vitamin E , chemically known as tocopherol , is categorized by structural formula into three types: α, β, and γ. α - Tocopherol is the most potent and widely distributed. Vitamin E can be transferred into milk, where its antioxidant properties extend the shelf life of goat milk. Normally, vitamin E is abundant in goat diets, particularly cereals , so supplementation is rarely necessary . Goats consuming pastures high in nitrates and soils low in nitrates may develop vitamin E deficiency , but there is currently no data on symptoms of vitamin E deficiency in goats. The recommended dosage for goats is unclear , but 5-100 mg of α - tocopherol should meet their needs. Vitamin E is primarily absorbed in the small intestine, but the stomach also absorbs it. Adipose tissue and the liver are the body's storage sites for vitamin E.

Vitamin K: Any fresh or dried green leaves are a good source of vitamin K. The rumen microorganisms of adult goats can synthesize a large amount of vitamin K2, so there is no need to add vitamin K to goat feed.

Vitamin B : Rumen microbes can synthesize vitamin B , so adult goats do not need to supplement their diets with it . Besides the rumen, goats absorb vitamin B primarily in the duodenum, using both active and passive absorption mechanisms. When vitamin B concentrations are high in the intestine, passive absorption occurs; when concentrations are low, active absorption occurs. Vitamin B is a coenzyme component of many enzymes and plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism and nerve conduction. While adult goats can meet their vitamin B needs with rumen microbes , the rumen of newborn goats is not fully developed, and rumen microbes cannot synthesize sufficient amounts of vitamin B. Therefore, newborn goats must supplement their vitamin B intake with goat milk or milk replacer . Vitamin B deficiency in both young and adult goats can cause polioencephalomalacia (cerebrocortical necrosis).

vitamin B hypovitaminosis in adult goats are as follows: 1. Certain plants ( e.g., oak bark) contain thiamin antimetabolites ( which do not activate thiamin enzymes ) . 2. Certain bacteria or molds produce thiamin antimetabolites in feed. 3. Increased vitamin B requirements due to carbohydrate-rich feed intake .

Vitamin C: Except for primates such as humans and monkeys, which need to obtain vitamin C from food, the tissues of most livestock and poultry can synthesize vitamin C to meet their body needs.

Rumen Physiology in Meat Sheep: Meat sheep are ruminants, and their stomachs are divided into four parts: the rumen, the reticulate stomach, the omasum, and the abomasum. At birth, the rumen accounts for only 27% of the total stomach volume, but by adulthood, it has grown to 85% . The rumen of adult sheep can accommodate large amounts of feed and harbor a large population of microorganisms. These microorganisms help the sheep break down high-fiber feeds, which are unusable by the stomach's own lining, into usable monosaccharides. Microorganisms also utilize the energy gained from fiber breakdown to convert protein, amino acids, and even urea nitrogen in the feed into microbial protein. In short, the sheep's rumen is like a fermentation tank, where microorganisms continuously thrive and provide nutrients for the host's survival. However, to fully utilize the rumen's functions in meat sheep, they must provide high-quality feed during the lambing period to stimulate rumen development and expand rumen capacity , enabling the sheep to fully utilize its microbial protein production.

Dry matter intake: When formulating any livestock feed, the animal's daily dry matter intake must be considered to ensure the animal's daily nutritional needs are met within a limited feed intake. Livestock dry matter intake varies significantly depending on the animal's body weight, growth stage, pregnancy, nursing, lactation, housing facilities, feed type, forage fiber content, climate, social status, and whether the animal is housed or free-range. Therefore, feed supply must be adjusted accordingly based on increases or decreases in dry matter intake. Sheep are small ruminants, and smaller animals consume less, so dry matter intake has a greater impact on their growth and production traits. In Taiwan, the daily dry matter intake of sheep ranges from 1.8% to 3.8% of body weight , with 1.4% to 1.7% of dry matter intake representing the minimum requirement for survival. The dry matter intake percentage for lambs is approximately 2.8% to 3.0% . For mature sheep, it's about 2.3% to 2.4% , for older breeders or rams, it's about 2.0% to 2.2% , and for lactating sheep, it can reach as high as 3.8% . Inadequate dry matter intake in meat sheep can lead to slow weight gain at best, and weight loss and decreased milk production at worst.

Sheep require energy to meet their basic maintenance, growth, fattening, pregnancy, and lactation needs. Energy requirements vary depending on breed, weight, growth stage, and environment. For example, the energy density of a fattening mutton ration must be higher than that of a lamb or lamb. Furthermore, in the summer, when mutton intake decreases, the energy density of the ration must be higher than in the winter. Corn, barley, molasses, cassava, bran, rice bran, and oils are all excellent sources of energy in concentrate feeds. Forage grasses such as bulgur, pennisetum, and Bermuda hay are excellent sources of energy in forage. These energy-rich feed ingredients are broken down in the rumen by rumen microorganisms to form glucose and volatile short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Some of these short-chain fatty acids are absorbed by the rumen and synthesized into nutrients essential to mutton. Acetate and butyrate are synthesized into milk fat, while propionate is synthesized into glucose or amino acids. Therefore, the ability of mutton to utilize other nutrients in the diet depends entirely on sufficient energy supply.

When calculating mutton feed formulas, energy can be expressed as total digestible nutrients (TDN) , metabolizable energy (ME) , digestible energy (DE) , or net energy (NE) . The net energy system, due to its independent and additive nature, allows for a more accurate estimate of animal production or growth performance. However, its methodology is relatively complex. The calculation of total digestible nutrients is relatively simple and is the most accessible and accessible of the various energy systems.

Energy deficiency is a common problem when formulating mutton sheep feeds. This is often due to insufficient feeding or a diet with low energy concentration. Most sheep farmers don't pay much attention to the problem of low-energy diets, but they are unaware that when mutton sheep consume such diets, they can experience slowed growth, weight loss, ineffective estrus, a shortened lactation period, decreased milk production, and a significantly reduced resistance to parasites and disease.

Protein: Protein is a key component of meat sheep's body tissues, and they require a continuous intake of protein to renew their cells. Rumen microbes typically break down protein in feed into peptides, free amino acids, and ammonia. Rumen microbes then use the ammonia to synthesize their own bacterial protein. Rumen protein production accounts for approximately 65% to 70% of a sheep's daily amino acid requirement . Once the microbial cells enter the abomasum, they are digested and broken down by the microbes before being absorbed and utilized in the small intestine.

Bypass protein in feed flows to the abomasum, where it is broken down by gastric acid into peptides and amino acids. Bypass protein is derived from certain feed protein molecules bonded with specific chemical substances, such as tannins, lignin, and acid-washed fiber, that resist degradation by rumen microorganisms. The percentage of bypass protein in a feed varies greatly depending on the feed's characteristics, generally ranging from 30% to 40% . The quality and quantity of bypass protein in a diet significantly impacts sheep weight gain and feed efficiency. Feed manufacturers do not want essential amino acids in feed to be broken down in the rumen. Therefore, they often use physical or chemical methods to increase the proportion of bypass protein in feed formulation. Examples include flaking corn, cooking soybean meal, spraying tannins on pasture, saponifying fats or minerals, and encapsulating amino acids. However, higher levels of bypass protein in a diet can reduce rumen ammonia concentrations, which in turn reduces rumen microbial production and, in turn, affects the total amino acid content reaching the sheep's small intestine.

In formulating mutton feeds, protein is expressed as either crude protein or digestible protein. Soybean meal, fish meal, blood meal, feather meal, brewer's meal, and sorghum distillers' meal are all excellent sources of protein supplements. The protein percentage of mutton concentrates typically ranges from 18% to 14% . Lamb concentrates typically contain 18% protein. Adult sheep typically have a protein percentage of 16 % , while dry breeder sheep or rams typically have a protein percentage of 14% .

Protein intake must not only meet the daily metabolic needs of sheep, but also their needs during growth, fattening, reproduction, and lactation. Therefore, protein requirements vary for sheep of different breeding objectives and weights. When dietary protein is insufficient, sheep utilize amino acids in their blood and protein in their muscles to balance these needs. However, chronic protein deficiency can lead to slower growth, decreased appetite, weight loss, coarse fur, decreased lactation, irregular estrus, and reduced conception rates. Therefore, sheep farmers must pay close attention to protein intake when balancing their diets.

Minerals: Generally speaking, grazing sheep are not deficient in minerals, as most of the minerals in the soil are absorbed by plant matter and subsequently consumed by the grazing sheep. However, since Taiwan's sheep farming has shifted from free-range to confinement, mineral deficiencies often occur due to insufficient minerals in the concentrate feed. This mineral deficiency often leads to physiological and metabolic disorders in sheep, thus affecting their production efficiency.

Calcium: Calcium is a vital mineral that helps animals grow and repair bones and teeth, regulates nerve and muscle function, regulates acid-base balance, aids blood clotting, activates coenzymes, and generally provides essential nutrients for growth and production. The plasma calcium level in meat sheep is typically maintained at a stable 10mg/100ml . A rapid drop in the plasma calcium level in ewes can lead to milk fever . Because lambs require and absorb more calcium than adult sheep, calcium deficiency during pregnancy can result in rickets or osteomalacia in their offspring. Calcium deficiency in adult sheep can lead to osteoporosis, making bones porous, brittle, and prone to fractures. While meat sheep can tolerate high-calcium diets, excessive calcium intake not only impairs energy and protein utilization but also reduces the absorption of manganese and zinc ions, ultimately affecting their efficiency in weight gain. Generally, calcium in meat sheep feeds is primarily sourced from legumes, dairy products, and fish meal. Due to the influence of grass fiber bonding, the utilization rate of calcium in grass is not high for meat sheep, and the calcium concentration in cereals is also low. Therefore, when preparing meat sheep concentrate, an appropriate amount of shell powder, calcium hydrogen phosphate or limestone powder is often added to make the meat sheep concentrate contain about 0.3~0.8% calcium to meet the calcium needs of meat sheep.

Phosphorus: Phosphorus also helps with the growth and repair of bones and teeth. It is a component of proteins and phospholipids in animals. It participates in various animal metabolisms, activates B vitamins, and maintains blood acid-base balance. It is a fundamental unit of energy transfer in mutton sheep and is essential for their reproduction and production.

Phosphorus deficiency can lead to loss of appetite, poor weight gain, reduced milk production, emaciated appearance, and emaciated appearance in mutton sheep, thus affecting their reproductive efficiency. Furthermore, severe phosphorus deficiency can lead to pica, a behavior characterized by wool-gnawing, skin-eating, and other edible items. Sheep fed a high-phosphorus diet experience elevated plasma phosphorus concentrations, and the excess phosphorus reacts with calcium and magnesium ions to form phosphate precipitates. These precipitates can accumulate in the kidneys or urinary system, forming urinary stones. Wethers fed a high-phosphorus diet can develop severe urinary stones. Sheep with urinary stones experience abdominal and urethral pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, and, in severe cases, even death. To prevent urinary stones, a calcium-to-phosphorus ratio of 1.5:1 to 2.0:1 is ideal for mutton sheep to facilitate their absorption and regulation of calcium and phosphorus.

Grass typically contains a lower percentage of phosphorus, while cereals contain a higher percentage. Therefore, grazing sheep only need to pay special attention to phosphorus deficiency, while confined sheep must pay attention to an oversupply of phosphorus. Meat sheep feed can contain approximately 0.3-0.7% phosphorus, which can be supplemented with calcium dihydrogen phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, fish meal, etc.

Magnesium: Magnesium is one of the elements that promotes enzyme activation and plays a vital role in coenzyme function, carbohydrate metabolism, energy transfer, and nervous system transmission. It also affects calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Magnesium deficiency can lead to poor digestibility, cramps, and coma in mutton sheep. In severe cases, mutton sheep may develop grass tetamy , which can lead to death. Excessive magnesium intake can also cause toxicity in sheep. The magnesium content of cereal feed generally ranges from 0.12% to 0.18% , while that of forage ranges from 0.3% to 0.6% . Inadequate magnesium in mutton sheep feed can be supplemented with magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, and magnesium sulfate.

Sulfur: Sulfur is a key component of sulfur-containing amino acids and a building block for many coenzymes. It is also a crucial factor influencing protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Sulfur deficiency can lead to decreased appetite, weight loss, salivation, metabolic disorders, and even death in sheep. It also affects the interaction between copper and molybdenum ions. However, excess sulfur can also cause diarrhea, respiratory distress, and even death in sheep.

Feed protein is rich in sulfur ions, making it less susceptible to sulfur deficiency in mutton sheep. If deficiencies occur, supplementation with copper sulfate, calcium sulfate, and zinc sulfate can be used. Rumen microbes synthesize inorganic sulfur into organic sulfur. Therefore, if adequate sulfur is provided, rumen microbes will synthesize essential amino acids such as methionine. Rumen microbes are most efficient in producing sulfur-containing amino acids when the nitrogen-to-sulfur ratio in mutton sheep feed is 10 : 1 .

Potassium: Potassium ions play a physiological role in sheep, balancing cellular fluids. Potassium deficiency can lead to nutritional and endocrine imbalances in mutton sheep, resulting in weight loss. High-potassium diets can impair magnesium utilization, causing grass cramps and lamb mortality. Because pastures contain high potassium levels, mutton sheep are less susceptible to potassium deficiency. If potassium supplementation is needed in mutton sheep feed, potassium chloride can be added.

Sodium and Chloride: Sodium and chloride ions play a physiological role in sheep, balancing osmotic pressure, pH, and body fluids. Sodium ions activate glucose-carrying proteins, while chloride ions, in addition to activating amylase, also promote gastric acid synthesis. Herbivores in tropical regions can suffer from sodium deficiency due to the low sodium content of pasture and the loss of body fluids caused by the hot climate. Sodium and chloride deficiency in mutton sheep reduces their appetite, growth rate, and protein metabolism efficiency. Therefore, 0.5% crude salt should be added to the mutton concentrate. Most animals can tolerate excessive salt intake if they are adequately watered. However, excessive salt intake can cause weight loss and physiological disorders in mutton sheep.

Trace minerals: Cobalt, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, selenium, and zinc are all trace minerals. Although the daily requirement for meat sheep is very small, they are essential components for their metabolism. A deficiency in any trace element often affects the absorption and utilization of other trace minerals, minerals, and vitamins. However, excessive trace minerals can cause toxicity in meat sheep, so they must be supplemented with caution and in moderation.

Cobalt: One of the main elements of vitamin B12 , it also activates coenzymes. Rumen microorganisms in adult sheep utilize cobalt to synthesize vitamin B12 . A deficiency can lead to weakness, slow growth, and low reproductive efficiency. The optimal cobalt concentration in a sheep's diet is 0.1 ppm per dry matter . Deficiencies can be supplemented with cobalt sulfate or carbonate. However, excessive cobalt intake can also cause symptoms such as excessive urination, salivation, and rapid breathing.

Copper: Its primary functions include hair synthesis, iron absorption, hemoglobin formation, and metabolism. Since many coenzymes require copper ions for activation, copper deficiency can lead to metabolic abnormalities. Excessive copper intake can also cause nausea, vomiting, salivation, abdominal pain, and even death in sheep. The optimal copper concentration for domestic sheep is 8 to 10 ppm per dry matter . Since most cereals are copper-deficient, copper sulfate can be added to concentrates.

Iodine: Its primary function is to synthesize thyroid hormones. Animals can become deficient in iodine if they consume forage or grains grown in iodine-deficient soil. This can lead to goiter, which is most common in young animals. Sheep require 0.4mg to 0.6mg of iodine daily. Potassium iodide can be added to concentrate feed to address iodine deficiency, but excessive iodine intake can also reduce feed intake and weight gain.

Iron: Iron primarily provides hemoglobin synthesis and acts as an enzyme activating catalyst. Therefore, animals deficient in iron can develop anemia. Iron deficiency typically occurs in lactating young animals due to the low iron content in milk. Adult animals are less susceptible to iron deficiency because their feed contains sufficient iron. Sheep require 30 to 40 mg of iron daily. Iron deficiency can be addressed by adding ferrous sulfate to the concentrate premix. However, excessive iron intake can also reduce feed intake and weight gain.

Manganese: Mainly found in the coenzyme system of meat sheep, a deficiency can affect growth, reproductive efficiency, and the functioning of the animal's central nervous system. The manganese content in breeder sheep feed is approximately 40 ppm per dry matter diet. Because manganese content varies greatly between forage and cereals, and manganese utilization by animals also varies depending on factors such as soil pH and fertilization, manganese oxide can be added to meat sheep feed.

Selenium: It is primarily related to the absorption and utilization of vitamin E. Animals deficient in selenium have low conception rates. In severe cases, afterbirth can be retained in the uterus, leading to uterine inflammation and affecting future reproductive performance. Therefore, sodium selenite and other supplements can be added to concentrates. The selenium concentration in mutton feed is approximately 0.1 mg/kg of dry matter. Excessive selenium can cause loss of appetite, tail hair loss, and death in mutton. Acutely poisoned animals may develop symptoms such as blindness and unsteady gait.

Zinc: It primarily supports the development of wool, bones, and keratin in mutton sheep. It also affects the synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Therefore, zinc deficiency not only affects reproductive performance but also weakens the keratin in the feet of mutton sheep. In the later stages of fattening, mutton sheep are more susceptible to hoof injuries due to their weight, which in turn affects their mobility and appetite. The zinc concentration in mutton sheep feed is approximately 50 mg/kg of dry matter. Zinc oxide or zinc sulfate can be added to mutton sheep feed.

Vitamins: Vitamins are essential for the physiological metabolism of meat sheep. Generally speaking, fresh grass contains a high amount of these vitamins, so grazing sheep are not prone to vitamin deficiencies. However, for confined sheep, when their feed consists primarily of concentrates or hay, the vitamins in these feeds are often destroyed during feed processing and hay making. Therefore, vitamin supplementation is necessary to meet the physiological needs of meat sheep.

Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, chemically called retinol. Retinol is found only in animals, with the liver being the most abundant source. Plants, on the other hand, do not contain retinol, but they do contain beta-carotene. Research has shown that beta-carotene is a precursor to retinol. When animals ingest beta-carotene, it is converted into retinol in the intestines and other organs. Vitamin A plays a vital role in the growth and development of cells and tissues. Vitamin A deficiency in mutton sheep can lead to a decreased appetite, a lack of libido in rams, and poor semen quality. In ewes, estrus is difficult and reproductive efficiency is poor. More severe deficiency can lead to eye problems and night blindness. Therefore, mutton diets should contain at least 3,500 international units (IU) of vitamin A per kilogram of concentrate.

Vitamin D: Also a fat-soluble vitamin, it primarily helps animals efficiently absorb and utilize calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D deficiency in mutton sheep can lead to an imbalance in calcium and phosphorus absorption, affecting bone development and causing rickets and osteoporosis in both lambs and adults. Sunlight's ultraviolet rays, when applied to animal skin, convert 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3. Therefore, grazing sheep are not prone to vitamin D deficiency, but confined sheep require vitamin D supplementation. Therefore, when preparing mutton concentrate, it is important to ensure it contains at least 250 International Units (IU) of vitamin D per kilogram.

Vitamin E: Vitamin E (a-Tocopherol), also known as a reproductive alcohol, is essential for animals to maintain normal physiological functions. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin found in adipose tissue, particularly in the brain, liver, heart, adrenal cortex, and gonads. Vitamin E deficiency can lead to white muscle disease in lambs, miscarriage in ewes before birth, and retained placenta after birth. Lambs can supplement their needs with vitamin E injections, while adult sheep can supplement it with concentrate feed. Therefore, domestic sheep diets should contain at least 5 mg of vitamin E per kilogram of concentrate feed. Previously, vitamin E was added to address reproductive issues in ewes, but recent studies have shown that adding vitamin E to finishing feeds for mutton sheep not only increases feed conversion and improves growth traits, but also significantly improves meat quality, color, fatty acid rancidity, and preservation.

Vitamin K: Vitamin K can activate coagulation factors. It exists in many feed raw materials and can also be synthesized in the rumen, so it is not easy to be deficient.

Vitamin B complex and vitamin C: These are water-soluble vitamins that can be synthesized by rumen microorganisms. Therefore, vitamin B complex and vitamin C deficiency is not common in adult sheep. However, during lactation, as the rumen is not yet fully developed, vitamin B complex and vitamin C supplementation is necessary for lambs.

Water: Water is crucial for meat sheep, essential for all physiological and metabolic processes. While water content varies depending on breed, age, and environment, generally speaking, water accounts for approximately 75% of all body tissues. Water intake primarily comes from drinking water, feed water, and metabolic water. An adult sheep consumes approximately 4 to 12 liters of water per day. Lactating sheep require an additional 2.5 liters for every liter of milk produced. Factors that influence water intake include feed type, activity level, environment, temperature, and the protein and salt content of the diet. Water quality is also a key consideration when supplying meat sheep. Clean, uncontaminated water is essential. Farmers relying on groundwater as their primary water source are advised to have the water tested for contamination by heavy metals, pesticides, and nitrates. Drinking fountains are recommended as water supply equipment. If you place a bucket in the sheep pen and allow the sheep to drink freely, the bucket must be cleaned and disinfected regularly to prevent feed from falling into the bucket, contaminating the water and causing bacterial growth. Lack of water can lead to reduced feed intake, slowed growth, and decreased milk production. Therefore, sheep farmers should not neglect water supply in the sheep pen simply because it is easier to obtain.

The microorganisms in the rumen of mutton sheep are capable of synthesizing microbial proteins, but they still require adequate daily nutrition for effective utilization. A reasonable and balanced supply of nutrients, such as energy and protein, is crucial. Insufficient or uneven nutrition can lead to stunted growth and reduced reproductive efficiency, while excessive amounts of nutrients are wasted because they cannot be utilized. Therefore, formulating an appropriate feed requires a balanced diet.

In fact, over the years, advanced livestock farming countries around the world have completed numerous nutritional studies, providing a deep understanding of the energy, protein, mineral, and vitamin requirements of domestic sheep of varying weights and physiological conditions. These data serve as feeding standards, and this article adopts the 1981 standards for mutton sheep established by the US National Research Council (NRC). Based on these NRC standards and reference to domestic mutton sheep farming practices, domestic sheep farming is divided into eight stages. These stages are organized based on their dry matter intake and nutrient requirements, facilitating the calculation of balanced rations for each stage.

All grains are suitable as concentrates for goats; however, extremely high amounts of grains, especially flaked corn, can cause conditions such as acidosis. With the exception of corn and oats, it's unnecessary and undesirable to crush or process grains before feeding them to goats, as goats break them up while chewing, and crushed or processed grains often ferment too quickly. Whole grains have higher milk fat content than ground or threshed grains. Soybean meal is a common protein supplement, while bran is also commonly used in dairy goat diets. Bran has a high protein content, provides bulk, and has a laxative effect. Urea and other non-protein nitrogen sources are also commonly used in goat diets, generally at a level of less than 1% of the total concentrate. Goat concentrate preparation requires particular attention to palatability; any moldy or spoiled feed will be wasted. Therefore, even if it can be purchased very cheaply, it will be uneconomical compared to high-quality, well-manufactured materials. Bulk concentrates are prone to waste because goats will pick out ingredients they particularly like and reject others, whereas this doesn't happen with pellets or blocks. However, goats accustomed to a bulk concentrate diet may take some time to accept blocks. Giving goats ample time to adjust to a new diet is crucial, as they may refuse to eat a new concentrate for several days. In dairy goats, this can cause an immediate drop in milk production, so it's best to change the diet during the dry season or late lactation to avoid a loss in milk production. Whenever possible, it's best to start a new diet with younger goats, as these are less picky and will be well accustomed to the new diet by the time they reach production.

Formulating process for concentrated feed for dairy sheep: For a group of lactating sheep with an average weight of 60 kg, producing 3 kg of milk per day with a milk fat percentage of 4.0% , the concentrated feed consists of corn and soybean meal, and the coarse feed consists of pangla hay and corn silage. The concentrated feed is formulated as follows: 1. Calculate the nutrient requirements for each group or sheep: Net energy: 1.54 (Mcal) for maintenance, 2.1 (Mcal) for milk production ; crude protein: 105 (kg) for maintenance, 216 (kg) for milk production ; calcium: 4.0 (g) for maintenance, 9.0 (g) for milk production ; phosphorus: 2.8 (g) for maintenance, 6.3 (g) for milk production . 2. Estimating Forage Dry Matter Intake: According to NRC (1981) , a 60 kg lactating sheep requires 4% of its body weight ( or 2.4 kg ) of dry matter intake , of which feed intake is approximately 2% of its body weight. This means that 1.2 kg of forage (60 x 0.02 kg) should be provided, consisting of 0.6 kg of pangolin hay and 0.6 kg of corn silage. 3. Calculating Concentrate Requirements: After deducting the hay requirement, the remaining nutrient deficit is met by concentrate. This primarily balances energy needs. Since a net energy deficit of 2.32 Mcal is observed after providing 1.2 kg of forage, the energy requirement can be met by adding 1.14 kg of corn (2.03 Mcal/kg of DM). However, the protein content is insufficient, so it should be calculated with soybean meal. Assuming X kg of corn and Y kg of soybean meal, the following equation can be used: ( Corn net energy 2.03 Mcal/kg, crude protein 10%; soybean meal net energy 1.86 Mcal/kg, crude protein 50%): Energy: 2.03X + 1.86Y = 2.32; Protein: 0.10X + 0.50Y = 0.21. Therefore, adding 0.97 kg of corn and 0.23 kg of soybean meal can meet both energy and protein requirements. 4. Check the mineral balance: If calcium or phosphorus is insufficient, mineral supplements can be used to meet the needs. After supplementing the feed and concentrate, it was found that the calcium and phosphorus levels were 8 grams and 0.6 grams respectively. After adding 0.004 kg of calcium phosphate (each kg of calcium phosphate contains 210 grams of calcium and 180 grams of phosphorus, respectively), and 0.022 kg of limestone, the needs were met. 5. Check dry matter intake and pickled fiber intake and make sure they meet the requirements after adding them up.

Lamb concentrate formulation process: For a flock of lambs weighing an average of 20 kg and gaining 50 grams daily, the concentrate consists of corn and soybean meal, and the roughage consists of pangolin grass. The concentrate formulation is as follows: 1. Calculate the nutrient requirements for each flock or head of lamb: Digestible energy: 1.18 Mcal for maintenance, 0.44 Mcal for milk production; Crude protein: 38 kg for maintenance, 14 kg for milk production; Calcium: 2.0 g for maintenance, 1.0 g for milk production; Phosphorus: 1.4 g for maintenance, 0.7 g for milk production. 2. According to the NRC (1981), dry matter intake is 2.2% of body weight, or approximately 440 grams, of which 70 grams (0.35 % of body weight) of forage is provided . 3. Calculate concentrate requirements: After deducting hay requirements, the remaining nutrient deficit is provided by concentrate. This section primarily addresses energy needs. After providing 70 grams of forage, a net energy deficit of 1.45 Mcal and a protein deficit of 45 grams were observed. Assuming X kilograms of corn and Y kilograms of soybean meal , the following equation can be used to solve these problems: (corn digestible energy 4.0 Mcal/kg, 10% crude protein; soybean meal digestible energy 4.16 Mcal/kg, 50% crude protein): Energy: 4.0X + 4.16Y = 1.45; Protein: 0.10X + 0.50Y = 45. Therefore, adding 340 grams of corn and 22 grams of soybean meal would meet energy and protein requirements . 4. Checking the mineral balance: After providing forage and supplementing concentrate, calcium and phosphorus deficits of 2.56 and 0.79 grams, respectively, were observed. These deficits can be addressed by adding 5 grams of calcium phosphate and 5 grams of limestone. 5. Total daily dry matter intake should meet requirements.

Formulating a concentrate feed for mutton sheep: A flock of fattening wethers weighing an average of 30 kg and gaining 150 g daily is fed a concentrate diet consisting of corn and barley, and a roughage diet consisting of pennisetum. The concentrate feed is formulated as follows: 1. Calculate the nutrient requirements for each flock or head of sheep: Metabolizable Energy: 2.91 Mcal ; Crude Protein: 93 kg ; Calcium: 4 g ; Phosphorus: 2.8 g . 2. According to the NRC (1981), dry matter intake is 3.2% of body weight , or 960 g. Assume that 500 g of forage ( 52% of the ration ) is provided . 3. Calculate concentrate feed requirements: After deducting the hay requirement, the nutrient deficit is provided by concentrate feed. This portion primarily balances energy requirements. After providing 500 g of forage, a digestible energy deficit of 1.72 Mcal and protein of 49.5 g is found. Adding 400 grams of corn and 80 grams of barley can meet both protein and energy requirements (corn has a digestible energy of 3.75 Mcal/kg and crude protein of 10%; barley has a digestible energy of 3.70 Mcal/kg and crude protein of 13.5%). 4. After providing both forage and concentrate, a calcium deficiency of 0.84 grams and an increase of 0.71 grams of phosphorus were found. To meet the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio of 1.48, 6 grams of limestone (containing 340 grams of calcium per kilogram) were added to meet this critical calcium-to-phosphorus ratio.

Forage, or fodder, is the primary feed for herbivores. Whether the quality of forage meets the animals' needs and whether a sufficient and stable supply is available are key factors influencing the development of the herbivore industry. According to the 2003 Agricultural Annual Report of the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan , Taiwan's total annual dry matter forage production is approximately 257,975 metric tons, which only meets approximately 51.4% of the total annual demand for herbivores. The shortfall requires the use of imported hay. In recent years, Taiwan's average annual hay imports have been approximately 230,113 metric tons. Although Taiwan is located in the subtropics, the island is mountainous and experiences a variety of climates. Numerous forage grass species are cultivated or experimentally grown, including sedge, pennisetum, South African pigeon grass, bermuda grass, creeping clover, geranium, bahia grass, kayu grass, ryegrass, oats, green corn, sorghum, alfalfa, tropical kudzu, mountain pea, sedge bean, Java soybean, and Egyptian clover. However, commercial production primarily focuses on sedge, pennisetum, and green corn. In recent years, the Nile grass, developed at the Animal Husbandry Research Institute, has also been gradually promoted. Smaller amounts of alfalfa and Egyptian clover are also produced. Foreign forage grasses offer even more varieties. In addition to the aforementioned, there are dozens of other species, including red clover, white clover, timothy, bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, orchard grass, tall foxgrass, and paspalum. However, the main forage grasses imported into Taiwan are alfalfa, bermuda grass, timothy, and oats. The following will provide an extensive discussion of domestic and imported forage grasses, focusing on their characteristics, quality evaluation, and quality variations and grading, providing a reference for forage selection and utilization.

Forage Species Characteristics: A rich variety of forage resources are used worldwide, encompassing hundreds of species, ranging from grasses, legumes, broadleaf weeds, and sedges. However, grasses from the Poaceae and Legume families are predominant. Grasses are divided into two categories based on their growth characteristics : cool-season grasses ( C3 grasses) and warm -season grasses ( C4 grasses) . These differences primarily stem from their photosynthetic patterns and temperature adaptability. Cool-season grasses and warm-season grasses have C3 and C4 photosynthetic patterns , respectively. C4 grasses have taller leaves. Under light intensities exceeding 1200 umol m² s' , they have higher fiber content than C3 grasses. Their photosynthetic efficiency, however, can still increase with increasing light intensity, compared to C4 grasses. However, photosynthesis in C3 grasses approaches saturation. Temperate grasses are better adapted to low temperatures, photosynthesizing below 10 °C and inhibited above 30 °C. Tropical grasses, on the other hand, are better adapted to high temperatures. Therefore, temperate grasses are naturally distributed in cool temperate regions, while tropical grasses are more common in lower latitudes. Furthermore, tropical grasses have better water use efficiency than temperate grasses and are generally more drought-tolerant . Because C4 grasses have specialized vascular bundle sheaths, the proportion of mesophyll cells per unit leaf area in tropical grasses is lower ( mesophyll cells have a higher protein and digestible content ) . Consequently, at the same maturity, tropical grasses have lower crude protein content and slower digestion rates than temperate grasses. Legumes also follow a C3 photosynthesis pattern, but photosynthesis rates vary significantly among species, and they also have varying temperature adaptability. Alfalfa has a relatively high photosynthetic rate among legumes, with a rate between C3 and C4 grasses. It also has a wide temperature adaptability, exhibiting both temperate and tropical characteristics. Trifolium repens is a typical temperate legume, with photosynthesis inhibited by high temperatures, while kudzu is adapted to tropical climates and is a typical tropical legume.

In addition to photosynthesis patterns, various grass species, varieties, and ecotypes each possess unique characteristics due to long-term adaptation and human selection, resulting in distinct growth advantages and limitations. Consequently, different grasses have specific distribution areas and nutrient compositions, which in turn influence their nutritional value. However, overall, legumes are superior in quality to temperate grasses, which in turn are superior to tropical grasses. Pangu grass and Pennisetum, which make up the majority of domestically produced grass, are both typical tropical grasses characterized by low digestibility and protein content. Consequently, large quantities of alfalfa are imported annually to supplement these deficiencies . Another major imported grass is Bermuda grass, also a tropical grass. Although its price exceeds its actual nutritional value, it is also popular with livestock farmers due to its commercial availability.

Overview of forage quality: Forage quality is determined by two factors: "nutritional value" and "feed intake". The nutritional value is determined by the composition of the forage and the proportion that can be used by animals (digestibility). Plant cells consist of two parts: highly digestible cell contents (protein, sugar, fat, starch, pectin, etc.) and less digestible cell wall structures (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, etc.). High-quality forage has thin cell walls and a high proportion of cell contents. Therefore, it has high nutritional value, is easy to digest, has good palatability, and has a higher feed intake. Low-quality forage has a higher proportion of cell walls and contains more indigestible substances (such as lignin), resulting in low nutritional value and animal feed intake.

The quality requirements are determined by the grade of livestock, and different animals have different forage requirements. High-yielding lactating cows require forage with high digestibility, high energy, and high protein. If high-yielding lactating cows are fed low-quality forage, their milk production will never match that of cows fed high-quality forage. Compared to high-quality forage, low-quality forage remains in the rumen longer, resulting in reduced feed intake and output. This loss cannot be fully compensated even with supplements. Compared to high-yielding lactating cows, low-yielding or dry cows have lower nutritional requirements and do not require the highest-grade forage for efficient feeding.

Silage is a commonly used method of preserving forage. If the conditions are properly controlled, the nutritional value of forage can be effectively preserved. However, if the silage fermentation is poor or the feeding management is improper, it will not only reduce the nutritional value of the forage, but also reduce the palatability and digestibility, seriously affecting the utilization efficiency of the forage.

Forage intake is a lesser-studied and more complex issue. Measuring intake involves factors other than the forage itself, as well as factors related to the animal and the effects of management. Strictly speaking, aside from direct intake measurements, there is currently no simple and rapid method that can fully represent ad libitum intake. However, in certain applications, a negative correlation exists between medium-wash fiber content and ad libitum intake; therefore, for the same forage, medium-wash fiber content is often used as an indicator of ad libitum intake. In addition to the aforementioned factors, palatability is also a factor that cannot be ignored. The inclusion of dust in baled hay or its deterioration due to moisture during storage can easily affect palatability and reduce ad libitum intake.

Factors influencing forage quality: The primary factors are forage type, maturity at harvest, and preparation and storage methods. Secondary factors include soil fertility or fertilization, temperature during the growing season, and variety. The impact of forage type has been discussed above; the remaining factors are explained below: (1) Temperature: Forages grown at high temperatures have lower quality than those grown at lower temperatures. Forages grown at 10-15°C (10-15°C) have a leaf percentage of 59%, but at 20-25°C (20-25°C), this percentage is only 36%. (2) Maturity: Harvest maturity is the primary factor influencing a particular forage. Forage quality decreases with maturity. Dry matter digestibility of forage exceeds 80% in the first two to three weeks of growth, then decreases by 0.3-0.5% per day until it reaches approximately 50%. Harvest maturity also affects animal feed intake. As forage matures, its fiber content increases, causing animal feed intake to decline rapidly. As plants age, the mid-fat fiber content increases and the feeding potential decreases because the digestion rate of mid-fat fiber is lower than that of non-fiber parts. At the same time, the more mature the plant, the lower the fiber digestion rate. (3) Leaf/stem ratio: As forage ages (or matures) and is conditioned under adverse conditions, the leaf-stem ratio decreases and the forage quality decreases. The quality of the leaves of forage is higher than that of the stems, and the proportion of leaves decreases as the forage matures. For example, the crude protein content of the old stems of alfalfa may be less than 10%, while the content of the leaves can be as high as 24%. The quality of the upper leaves (young leaves) and lower leaves of alfalfa is similar, but the quality of the young stems and old stems is very different. Reproductive growth significantly reduces the leaf/stem ratio, which means that the quality is reduced. (4) Mixed growth of grasses and beans: Mixed forages of grasses and beans often have higher crude protein content and lower fiber content than pure grasses. Bermuda grass mixed with various legumes (without nitrogen fertilizer) produces forages with a crude protein content of 11% to 13%, while areas planted solely with Bermuda grass receiving 90 kg/ha of nitrogen fertilizer have a crude protein content of only 11%. Alfalfa mixed with 30% timothy hay has a crude protein content of 17.5%, while hay grown solely with alfalfa has a crude protein content of 25%. (5) Fertilization: Nitrogen fertilizer can indeed increase the crude protein content of grasses, but legumes do not require nitrogen fertilizer. Fertilization generally has no effect on improving digestibility. Phosphorus or potassium fertilizers can increase grass yield, but due to rapid growth, they may slightly reduce forage quality. Excessive amounts of certain elements in forages, such as potassium, may reduce the availability of magnesium in the diet. (6) Diurnal Variation: The water-soluble carbohydrate content of forages varies significantly throughout the day. During the day, plants accumulate water-soluble carbohydrates and consume them at night. Therefore, water-soluble carbohydrate content is lowest in the early morning and reaches its highest point after a period of intense light. Therefore, in low-rainfall climates, alfalfa harvested in the afternoon is of better quality than that harvested in the morning; and Pennisetum harvested after noon is more suitable for silage preparation. (VII) Variety Efficacy: Breeding may help improve forage quality. The digestibility of the Coastcross1 Bermuda strain can be increased by 12% compared to the Coastal strain, and the daily weight gain of beef cattle can be increased by 30%; the digestibility of late-maturing timothy grass decreases more slowly than that of early-maturing varieties; silage-type corn varieties have a higher grain content and a higher stem digestibility than other varieties; Pennisetum Taixucao No. 2 is easier to ensilage than older varieties due to its high water-soluble carbohydrate content. (VIII) Harvesting and Storage: In the early stages of forage harvest, the hydrolytic and respiratory enzymes in the cells are still functional, and nutrients are continuously decomposed and consumed, resulting in dry matter loss and the conversion of some protein into non-protein nitrogen. Prolonged curing time due to rain also significantly depletes nutrients in the plant. During hay storage, the digestibility of dry matter and other nutritional components decreases. Hay with a high moisture content will generate heat, forming more acid-insoluble nitrogen through the Millard reaction (polymerization of sugars or carbohydrates with amino acids due to respiratory heat), reducing the efficiency of protein utilization.

Sensory Assessment of Forage Quality: Observing the appearance of harvested forage on-site, such as leaf ratio, bale color, and the presence of spikes and other debris, can provide a rough assessment of forage quality. A high leaf content and greener leaf color indicate higher quality, but color alone is not a reliable indicator of quality. Different hay varieties vary in color, and excessive exposure to the sun or light rain can also affect hay color, but it can still be considered high-quality hay. Generally, the fiber content of forage increases after flowering, so a high spike content indicates lower quality. However, the relationship between ripeness and quality differs from that of standard forage, as green-cut corn kernels are a key source of energy. Weeds and grasses have low feeding value, while wire, nylon rope, and other impurities can easily cause harm to animals. Other impurities can also reduce palatability. Therefore, the presence of debris in hay significantly reduces its quality. Odor is also an important indicator. The presence of a musty or rancid odor indicates lower quality, and animals are less receptive to forage with a poor odor.

Nutrient Analysis: The nutritional content of forage grass varies depending on its variety, maturity, and growing environment. Therefore, accurate quantitative descriptions of its quality require compositional analysis. Traditional compositional analysis is performed using chemical analysis methods, primarily focusing on dry matter percentage, crude protein, acid-washed fiber, and medium-washed fiber. Various nutritional indicators can be derived from these results.

Dry matter (DM): Dry matter is the percentage of forage weight after removing moisture (DM% = 100 - % moisture). Understanding dry matter is important because, firstly, rations are formulated on a dry basis, and animal feed intake is expressed as dry matter intake, not feed volume. Secondly, forage nutrients are present in the dry matter portion. Furthermore, dry matter can serve as an indicator of forage storage conditions. Forage that is too dry for silage or too wet for baling can easily heat up, reduce protein availability, and cause mold. Forage that is too wet for silage can easily leak and cause improper fermentation losses.

Crude protein (CP): Crude protein includes true protein and non-protein nitrogen. The measurement method is to analyze the total nitrogen content and then multiply it by 6.25. The crude protein content can show whether the feed has the ability to meet the protein needs of animals. Feeding forage with medium to high crude protein content (14~20%) can reduce the purchase of protein supplements. The crude protein content will change with the harvest period of the forage. The higher the maturity, the lower the crude protein content, but the total crude protein quality per unit production area can increase with maturity. With proper management and harvesting, forage quality that is sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of animals can be obtained while also having appropriate yields.

Available Crude Protein (ACP): Available crude protein refers to the percentage of crude protein that can be effectively utilized by animals. For non-heating forage, no more than 12% of crude protein is contained in acid-washed fiber. For example, alfalfa with a crude protein content of 20% has an acid-washed fiber that contains no more than 2.4% crude protein. When the crude protein content of acid-washed fiber exceeds 12%, it indicates that the harvesting or storage process was improper, resulting in a decrease in the availability of crude protein. The more crude protein contained in the acid-washed fiber, the lower the crude protein availability.

Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF): Acid Detergent Fiber refers to the proportion of indigestible or slowly digestible substances in a forage or feed, including cellulose, lignin, and pectin. A low ADF content indicates a high digestibility ratio, indicating higher quality forage.

Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF): Neutral Detergent Fiber refers to the proportion of cell walls or fiber in a forage or feed, including acid-detergent fiber (excluding pectin) and hemicellulose. NDF is inversely proportional to an animal's feeding potential; low NDF levels indicate high feed intake. However, ruminants must have a certain amount of fiber in their diets to facilitate this process.

Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN): TDN is commonly used to express the energy content of feed or forage. The TDN reported in the analysis is calculated from crude protein, acid-washed fiber, and other components.

Net Energy (NE): Net energy is a more detailed calculation of energy than gross digestible nutrients. It includes net energy for lactation, net energy for maintenance, and net energy for growth, all expressed in Mcal/kg. Net energy for maintenance and growth is primarily used in formulating beef cattle rations, while net energy for lactation is used in formulating dairy cattle rations. Dietary energy is equally effective for maintaining and lactating milk production, but is less effective for weight gain (growth).

Relative Feed Value (RFV): RFV combines key nutritional factors, including feed intake potential and digestibility, into a single index, allowing for a quick and easy assessment of diet quality and feeding effectiveness. The formula for calculating RFV is derived from the estimated digestibility of acid-washed fiber and medium-washed fiber, respectively, and feed intake.

Minerals: All forages should be analyzed for calcium and phosphorus. Many routine analyses also include other minerals, especially in areas prone to mineral deficiencies. The mineral content of forages can reduce the need for expensive mineral supplements.

Traditional chemical analysis is time-consuming and expensive. Accurately adjusting diets, monitoring nutritional status, and selecting forage raw materials based on forage quality fluctuations requires rapid analysis. In recent years, the use of near-infrared spectroscopy for rapid forage quality analysis has become a trend. In addition to its rapid analysis speed, near-infrared spectroscopy offers advantages such as simple sample preparation, non-destructiveness, the ability to analyze multiple components simultaneously, and high accuracy and reliability. Domestically, we have developed a system for analyzing the general quality components of domestically produced sedge grass, pennisetum, green cut (silage) corn, and major imported grasses.

Hay Sampling Method: Hay sampling and analysis aims to represent the quality of the entire batch, so careful sampling methods are crucial to ensure that the sample is representative. A batch of hay is defined as hay of the same seed composition, same pasture, and maturity, cut within a certain timeframe (generally no more than 48 hours), and baled under the same weather conditions. If the same large pasture has different seed compositions, soil properties, weed infestation, maturity, cutting time, weather damage, or other factors that may alter hay value, each batch should be separated into different batches. If the stacking conditions of a batch vary significantly, more bales should be inspected or the hay should be divided into smaller batches. At least 15-20 bales should be randomly sampled and mixed to represent the entire batch. The Canadian Grassland Association's certification system stipulates that for small square bales under 1,000 bales, 20 bales must be sampled; for bales between 1,000 and 10,000 bales, 30 bales must be sampled ; and for bales over 10,000 bales, 50 bales must be sampled . For round bales under 50 bales , 20 bales must be sampled; for bales between 51 and 500 bales, 30 bales must be sampled ; and for bales over 500 bales, 50 bales must be sampled. To ensure uniform sampling of all layers, sampling should be done with a corer. The corer should be at least 12 inches long, with an inner diameter between 0.5 inches and 1.25 inches. It should be capable of obtaining 20 core samples, totaling at least one pound or one liter. Core samples should be obtained from bales at varying heights and depths along the pile. Insert the corer vertically from the side of the bale toward the center.

Pangolagrass ( Digitaria decumbens) is a tropical grass and one of the highest-quality tropical grasses. However, there's a significant difference in quality between high-quality pangolagrass harvested at the right time and stored well, and low-quality pangolagrass harvested after aging and stored poorly.

Pre-harvest quality changes of pangu grass: As pangu grass plants mature, their medium and pickled fiber content increases and their crude protein content decreases. Yield and quality are negatively correlated; delayed harvesting can yield higher yields, but not high-quality hay. Pangu grass grows rapidly in high temperatures, accumulating indigestible parts. Furthermore, pangu grass tends to flower in the summer, further accelerating aging. Consequently, seasonal variations in pangu grass quality are evident. Summer-produced pangu grass must be harvested as early as possible (within six weeks), ideally before heading, to ensure quality. Furthermore, summer coincides with Taiwan's rainy season, making timely harvesting challenging in the field. This is especially true with insufficient harvesting machinery. Many fields cannot seize sunny days to harvest, often delaying harvest for months. This results in a lower nutritional value and should be classified as poorer quality, as can be determined by grass length and leaf-to-stem ratio.

Although Taiwan is a small region, hay harvesting seasons vary from region to region, and the optimal harvest period also varies. In northern Taiwan, winter temperatures are lower, and pan-ko grass stops growing, with the production season concentrated between May and September. In southern Taiwan, due to the rainy summers, hay preparation is difficult, requiring careful timing for preparation or silage. Winters are still mild, and in areas with irrigation, autumn, winter, and spring are the prime production seasons. During these periods, pan-ko grass grows slowly, preventing its nutritional value from rapidly declining. Furthermore, the lower humidity allows for the production of higher-quality hay.

Impacts of Pangu hay curing: Pangu hay has a moisture content of approximately 80% at harvest. Before drying to a certain moisture content (approximately 30%), respiration, saccharification, microbial activity, and other physiological reactions continue, resulting in material losses. Most of this loss is in the digestible portion, and the decomposed nitrogen is easily lost through evaporation or leaching. This results in an increase in mid- and acid-washed fiber and a decrease in crude protein. The decrease in crude protein is particularly significant at high temperatures. Rain during curing is a common adverse condition for domestic Pangu hay. Heavy rain can cause leaching of soluble carbohydrates, soluble nitrogen, soluble minerals, and fat, resulting in significant dry matter losses. This increases the percentages of mid- and acid-washed fiber and decreases the percentage of crude protein. If the rain is light, the impact on hay quality is primarily due to the prolonged drying time, during which microbial activity within the hay continues, consuming nutrients. Freshly cut hay is less affected by rain. A light rain exposure, followed by rapid sun-drying, has minimal impact on quality.

Hay quality changes during storage: Hay quality continues to change during storage, with the degree of change varying depending on the moisture content at the time of baling and the temperature and humidity conditions during storage. The most rapid quality deterioration typically occurs within one month of baling. High moisture content at the time of baling, as well as high temperature and humidity in the storage environment, can easily lead to deterioration of hay quality. In Taiwan, under good storage conditions (ventilated and roofed), the moisture content of hay bales can drop below 11% after two months of storage, regardless of the initial moisture content, and the quality tends to stabilize. Poor storage conditions can lead to quality deterioration. The bales may appear yellow-green to yellow-brown or dark brown, or moldy, and may develop a burnt, alcoholic, or musty odor. Regarding compositional changes, crude protein content does not change significantly, but the indigestible fraction increases. Sometimes, high-moisture bales, due to greater dry matter loss, may actually increase the crude protein percentage, increase the percentage of medium-washed fiber and acid-washed fiber, and decrease digestibility. Taiwan's summers are hot and rainy, so the ideal moisture content for round bales is below 15%. If the bales are packaged at 20%, they will immediately heat up. If the climate is dry during packaging and storage (such as in autumn, winter, and early spring in southern Taiwan), an 18% moisture content is considered a safe moisture content for packaging . The safe moisture content for square bales can be 2% higher than for round bales.

Pennisetum purpurreum: Pennisetum purpurreum is a perennial, C4 , upright tropical forage grass with a tall plant structure. Its fresh grass yield can reach 250-400 metric tons per hectare, primarily used for forage and silage. In recent years, thanks to the popularization of the name "Taixu Grass No. 2," Pennisetum has seen significant increases in both yield and quality. Several high-quality dwarf and semi-dwarf varieties of Pennisetum are still available, but Taixu Grass No. 2 remains the primary variety currently cultivated. Because Pennisetum can be harvested year-round, its quality varies significantly depending on local climate, cultivation conditions, and maturity at harvest. The following describes the impact of various quality factors on green-cut quality.

Differences between Pennisetum strains: There are numerous Pennisetum strains, each with its own distinct plant shape and growth characteristics. Consequently, quality varies depending on the strain. Currently, the main cultivated strain is the Taichu No. 2.

The Impact of Harvest Maturity on Pennisetum: Maturity is the most important factor affecting Pennisetum quality. Regardless of whether the harvest indicator is days or height, delaying harvesting increases height and dry matter content, which may increase yield. However, this can significantly reduce quality, leading to a decrease in leaf-to-stem ratio, reduced crude protein content, increased fiber content, and decreased in vitro dry matter digestibility. Furthermore, the stem ages more rapidly than the leaves. While the content of water-soluble carbohydrates is higher in mature plants, this does not increase with delayed harvesting.

The impact of Pennisetum on seasons: As temperatures rise in summer, Pennisetum plants grow faster, resulting in taller plants and lower dry matter content. At the same time, the proportion of plant cell walls increases, the fiber content increases, the leaf-to-stem ratio decreases, and aging is also faster. Therefore, the green feed quality of Pennisetum in summer is lower; the quality of Pennisetum in other seasons is relatively better than in summer. However, adjusting cultivation and harvest management can also achieve better feed quality in summer, such as shortening the harvesting days and reducing the amount of fertilizer.

The Impact of Pennisetum on Fertility: Fertility significantly impacts the yield and yield traits of Pennisetum, particularly nitrogen fertilizer application. Increasing nitrogen fertilizer application rates for both tall and short-stemmed Pennisetum species helps increase leaf area, facilitates herb distribution, and boosts both fresh and hay yields. Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers have less of an impact. Regarding Pennisetum quality, nitrogen fertilizer application may increase crude protein content but has a limited effect on fiber content. Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers also have little effect on crude protein and fiber content. However, excessive potassium fertilizer application may result in an excessively high K/(Ca+Mg) ratio, which can easily lead to adverse physiological symptoms such as convulsions.

Green-cut corn: Green-cut corn refers to corn that has been harvested whole for animal consumption. It can be standard feed or food corn, or specialized green-cut corn varieties. Currently, the main specialized varieties in Taiwan include Tainan No. 19, Tainong No. 3, and Tainan No. 21. Corn is a single-year tropical grass plant that is adaptable to a wide range of temperatures and can be cultivated in both temperate and tropical zones. It is one of the most widely used forage crops worldwide. Because green-cut corn has cobs and contains large amounts of starch and sugars, it provides a higher-energy, high-quality forage crop than regular grasses, earning it the reputation of "king of forages." Harvested at the right time, it has an appropriate moisture content (approximately 65-70%) and sufficient water-soluble carbohydrates, making it easy to prepare into silage.

The vegetative growth phase of corn is from seed germination to flowering. During this period, yields are still low, and harvesting is not typically carried out. The reproductive growth phase begins with flowering and silking. The United States divides the reproductive growth phase into six stages: R1, R6 . These stages correspond to the silking, filling, milky, paste, yellow, and mature stages in China. The length of each growth stage is greatly affected by temperature. Temperate countries generally have one harvest per year, with both the vegetative and reproductive phases being longer. Taiwan generally has two harvests per year, with a relatively short reproductive phase, making it more difficult to determine the optimal harvesting time for silage. From the kernel filling stage on, the moisture content of the corn plant decreases dramatically daily from 80-85% to approximately 50-60% at mature stage . The rate of moisture reduction is affected by maturity and rainfall. The recommended harvesting period is around the yellow-ripe stage, but silage material requires more precise moisture control. The whey line, the dividing line between the whey and the hard part of the corn kernel's endosperm (referred to as the whey line), can be used as a harvest indicator, as it correlates well with the overall plant moisture content (although there is still some error).

Green-cut corn gradually increases in seed-to-grain ratio from the filling stage onward. After reaching the yellow ripening stage, the digestibility of the whole plant increases slightly, while the crude protein content decreases. Starch content in the whole plant gradually accumulates from the filling stage. During the early stages of ear ripening, water-soluble carbohydrates predominate in the non-structural carbohydrate content of the whole plant. However, starch becomes the primary component in later ripening, with starch accumulation peaking from the early milky to pasty stages. Starch digestibility decreases after yellow ripening, and rupturing the corn kernels during harvesting with a press can improve digestibility.

Nilegrass: Nilegrass, named Taichucao No. 1 , is a newly developed forage grass strain developed by the Animal Products Research Institute in 1999. Nilegrass (Acroceras macrum , nilegrass) is an upright, clumping temperate forage grass with a plant form somewhat similar to that of sedge, also with a creeping nature. It has strong growth vigour, is rust-resistant, and is relatively drought-tolerant.

The crude protein content of various Nilegrass strains decreases with increasing cutting time, while the medium-washed fiber and acid-washed fiber contents increase. The factors influencing and varying characteristics of Nilegrass quality are generally similar to those of Pangu grass, while the crude protein content is slightly higher than Pangu grass, and the medium- and acid-washed fiber contents are similar to those of Pangu grass. In terms of yield and quality, a cutting time of approximately 5-6 days is recommended for high yield and good hay quality. Using the height of the top leaf collar as an indicator trait provides a simple and effective way to estimate Nilegrass yield and quality.

Alfalfa ( Medicago sativa), native to southwestern Asia, is a highly nutritious legume with a long history of cultivation. Many countries around the world consider it a primary forage resource for livestock farming, earning it the reputation of "after fodder." Alfalfa is a perennial legume that grows in upright, clumps. Its leaves are pinnate, trifoliate, and arranged in whorls. The plant is 60 to 90 centimeters tall, with 5 to 25 branches and a taproot that can reach depths of 7 to 9 meters. Its inflorescence is sparsely racemose, ranging in color from purple to yellow, with 2 to 5 whorls. Each pod contains several kidney-shaped seeds. There are many varieties of alfalfa. Cultivated alfalfa can be broadly divided into four groups: Common , Variegated , Turkistan , and Nonhardy. Common , with its purple flowers, is a composite variety resulting from years of adaptation and selection of strains from multiple regions. It is often distinguished by its growing region, such as Montana Common and Kansas Common , and has different regional adaptability characteristics depending on the breeding area . Variegated , characterized by its variegated flower colors, ranging from purple to blue and white to yellow, is a hybrid of purple and yellow alfalfa and is extremely cold-resistant. Variegated varieties include Grimm , Ladak , Ranger , Atlantic , and Narragansett . Turkistan , like Common , belongs to the purple-flowered group and is cold-resistant, drought-resistant, and resistant to bacterial wilt. However, it also has unfavorable characteristics such as slow regeneration, low yield, low seed production, and susceptibility to leaf spot, making it a common source of material for disease-resistant breeding . Alfalfa is hardy, fast-growing and regenerating, but not cold-tolerant. Indian and African varieties are introduced from India and Africa, respectively, and are suitable for cultivation at lower latitudes. Generally speaking, alfalfa has a wide temperature adaptability and is well-suited to cultivation in well-drained areas. It is drought-tolerant but not wet-tolerant. Compared to other forage grasses, alfalfa contains a high amount of digestible protein and has a high feeding value. However, its quality varies considerably depending on the production region, harvest maturity, and variety characteristics.

Timothy (Phleum pratense) is native to northern Eurasia and is now found throughout temperate regions worldwide. It is a short-lived, perennial temperate grass that thrives in cool, wet climates. It is widely cultivated in the northern United States and Canada, either alone or in admixture with other grasses. Timothy is an upright, clumping grass, 60 to 120 cm tall, with densely packed spikelets forming a long, cylindrical shape. It has a shallow, fibrous root system and lacks underground roots or runners, making it incapable of vegetative propagation. New meadows are established by sowing, resulting in high seed yields and rapid, easy reestablishment. Timothy is primarily used for hay production. In meadows mixed with clover or alfalfa, a single cutting is often used to make hay, which is then used for grazing.

Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) is a group of deep-rooted, tropical perennial grasses found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. They thrive in temperatures above 23°C and are drought-tolerant. While they tolerate flooding, their growth is limited by waterlogging. Bermudagrass exhibits significant variation within species, with numerous varieties including Common, Giant Coastal, Tifton44, and Tifton85. Common is a local variety also used for turfgrass. It has small stems and leaves and is harvested for hay or as the remaining stalks after turfgrass seed harvesting. Its nutritional value is low. Both the Coastal and Tifton series are improved forage grasses with taller plants and larger leaves, but their cultivation has been limited. Bermudagrass production in the southern United States still primarily relies on local varieties. Bermudagrass imported into Taiwan is primarily a thin-stemmed local variety. Bermuda grass is the largest imported grass in the family Poaceae. Its advantages are that it is finely chopped, dried and well packaged. Although the acid-washed fiber content is lower than that of Bermuda grass, its dry matter digestibility is not higher.

Imported Hay Quality Grading: Taiwan imports a vast amount of hay annually. Each type of hay has varying quality grades, and even batches of the same type can vary significantly. Analytical data from the Hengchun Branch of the Animal Research Institute shows that the mean and standard deviation values for crude protein, medium-washed fiber, and acid-washed fiber content of imported alfalfa, Bermuda grass, oats, and Timothy are close to those in the United States, indicating that various hay grades are likely entering Taiwan. Further understanding of the quality fluctuations of imported hay and the grading system for exported hay based on its origin is crucial. The United States currently lacks a nationally consistent grading system, and the single standard proposed by the American Grass and Pasture Association, encompassing legumes, grasses, and mixed grass-legume forages, has not been widely adopted. The grading system for alfalfa is the most comprehensive. As early as 1933, the United States had a federal standard based on appearance. Although it has been revised many times, it has not been widely used because the appearance grading lacks objectivity and has little correlation with animal performance. Later, with the development of component determination, grading systems that can reflect feeding value have been established. However, the grading systems are currently inconsistent between states, and most are based on feeding value.

Grading of grasses is less sophisticated than alfalfa. Currently, most grasses are graded based on appearance. The USDA's unified standard only measures crude protein, while individual producing regions have their own standards based on export needs. Bermuda grass can be broadly divided into straw and hay. Bermuda grass, a byproduct of lawn seed harvest, has lower nutritional value and is rarely exported. A survey of distributors in Southern California found that Bermuda hay is classified into grades A , B , C , and D based on length, color, texture, weed content, and the presence of old grass. Each grade is further subdivided into grades of + , 0 , and - . Only grades C and above are intended for export . Canadian export timothy hay is also graded based on appearance, with color being the primary criterion. Recently, optical color scanning systems have been developed as an objective grading standard. In summary, current grass grading standards, which primarily rely on appearance, are subjective and fail to reflect feeding value. Differing standards and preferences in importing regions further complicate grading. With the advancement of rapid quality measurement, rapid methods that can reflect feeding value and objectively grade grass hay will play a crucial role.

Behavior of dairy goats: Based on the available data, only a brief introduction can be given to the study of goat behavior. Many inferences about goat behavior patterns are mostly derived from animals of more closely related genera such as sheep, deer, antelope or elk. Among these animals of similar genera, many behavioral characteristics are indeed similar, but it is also important to understand some basic behavioral differences between them. Understanding the unique behavior of goats can help managers establish a flock management system in an effective manner. Understanding goat behavior patterns can achieve at least the following two advantages. First, it enables managers to provide a more consistent and efficient management system to increase economic benefits. Second, the more knowledge related to goat behavior is learned, the more it will help promote a deeper understanding of goats and increase the enjoyment of raising goats. Goats have nine recognized behavioral patterns, of which ingestive and allelomimetic behaviors (imitating) are the most interesting. Sexual behavior , agonistic or antagonistic behavior , epimeletic behavior (care-giving maternal) , and et-epimeletic behavior (care-seeking ) are also important, and all of these behaviors are seasonal. The true importance of specific eliminative behaviors is still less understood.

Grazing : Goats differ from other ruminants in their preference for browsing , contrary to other herbivores. Naturally, goats are not major destructors of vegetation, but rather roam large pastures, selectively grazing on grasses and twigs. When confined, due to the reduced availability of grass, goats are less selective, consuming large quantities of twigs and small shrubs. Goats display distinct preferences for certain feeds and often consume over 25 plant species. This diverse preference is beneficial for goats, as many of the wild grasses favored by goats are high in minerals and protein, primarily due to their deep roots. This grazing behavior provides a valuable compensation for livestock managers, as pastures previously grazed by cattle or other livestock can be used by goats for grazing, increasing production efficiency and providing managers with the added benefit of utilizing the land with a diverse range of animals. This is also why goats are less prone to bloat than other ruminants. Goats graze on juicy leguminous pastures without the problem of overgrazing, and the grass and young branches they eat are enough to provide the roughage needed for normal fermentation in the goat's rumen.

Under extensive grazing systems, goats will almost universally refuse to eat any plant matter contaminated by the odor of urine or feces from their own kind. From an evolutionary perspective, this unique trait prevents the spread of parasites. However, in confined areas with highly contaminated soil, goats may still be forced to eat such contaminated plants, with undesirable consequences.

The amount of grass a goat consumes depends on its metabolic rate and body weight, and is also affected by the breed and age of the goat. The type and growth stage of the grass also affect the amount of grass a goat consumes. A goat's feed intake varies with the ambient temperature, and appetite is controlled by the brain's thermoregulatory mechanism. When the ambient temperature drops, both the time and rate of feeding tend to increase. However, when the ambient temperature drops below 10°C, feeding activity decreases. There is a correlation between low temperatures and reduced water intake, which leads to a decrease in dry matter intake. When the crude fiber digestibility of the feed increases, the actual digestibility of the dry matter increases.

Goats can distinguish bitter, salty, sweet, and sour tastes, and their tolerance for bitterness is higher than that of other ruminants. Bark , leaves, roots, small shrubs, and branches are more bitter than grasses, root crops, or forage, which may explain their preference for tender shoots. Goats also have a good sense of sweetness. While a moderate amount of salt is crucial for goats, they generally refuse to eat anything above 5g/100cc .

Goats appear to spend more time feeding each day than other ruminants, often lasting up to 11 hours. This is often misunderstood because goats spend more time and travel longer distances searching for food each day than cattle or sheep. The length and regularity of rumination are negatively correlated with the goat's alertness. Goats typically have longer, more regular ruminations when they are semi-asleep. Sudden noise exposure can cause rumination to become irregular. Rumination usually ceases when a goat is fully awake.

Drinking Behavior: Goats are well-adapted to water restriction and deprivation, as their water turnover rate is only 188cc/kg/24 hours. This is comparable to camels, which can survive prolonged water deprivation, with a water turnover rate of 185cc/kg/24 hours. Sheep and cattle have water turnover rates of 197cc/kg/24 hours and 347cc/kg/24 hours, respectively, both higher than goats. In certain seasons, when sweating or respiration are not necessary to maintain body temperature, goats can generally obtain adequate water from their feed if the moisture content of the forage is 60% or above. When the ambient temperature is about 38°C, the goat's respiration rate (respiratory cooling) is only about half that of a sheep. At this time, the goat's sweating is quite limited, and the water loss through feces and urine is greatly reduced. When the amount of water consumed is reduced for several consecutive days, the goat's urine output will be relatively reduced, and the urea concentration in the blood will increase. Lactating goats drink more water than ordinary sheep because milk contains about 85% water. Therefore, the higher the milk production of the ewe, the more water it drinks. A ewe that produces 8 pounds of milk per day needs the same amount of water every day to meet its lactation needs.

Suckling lambs: Within a short period of time after birth, lambs will try to find any part of the ewe's body that they can bite. Usually, newborn lambs will try to suckle between the ewe's two front legs, and finally they will find the nipple and actually start suckling. In the first one or two days after giving birth, when normal lambs are hungry, they can usually find the nipple quickly to suckle. When suckling, lambs usually bump against the ewe's udder, which can promote milk let-down and increase the amount of milk supplied to the lambs. The lamb's suckling reflex can be easily transferred to a bottle or milk bucket, so after the lambs have consumed an appropriate amount of colostrum, the ewe can return to the normal lactating flock.

Chasing or Escape Behavior: The development of specific chasing or escape behaviors among goats also appears to have some evolutionary significance. While many other animals commonly use urine or defecation as territorial marking, there is no clear evidence of this behavior in goats. However, male goats can detect estrus by sniffing the urine of ewes. In the wild, chasing behavior is sporadic, and when grazing, goats avoid areas where other animals urinate or defecate. This escape behavior is suppressed in confinement and in areas with extensive soiling. Ewes adopt a half-crouching position similar to that of female dogs when urinating, while males arch their backs and bend their legs, but adult males lack this behavior. Goats often wag their tails back and forth during defecation, but the significance of this behavior remains unclear.

Sexual Behavior: For goats, at least most of those from temperate regions, sexual behavior is affected by the seasons. The estrus cycle ceases in late spring and summer, and the libido of rams is very low during these months. Semen volume reaches its lowest point in early spring, and sperm motility is also poor in winter. Semen volume and sperm motility are highest in late summer and autumn. Rams typically resume sexual activity more quickly, about two weeks before the return of estrus in ewes . It is believed that the courtship stimulation of rams accelerates the onset of the ewe's breeding season. The length of a goat's breeding season is influenced by factors such as light, temperature, and latitude. Goat breeds from higher latitudes and mountainous regions have a shorter breeding season. The estrus cycle of all goats peaks in autumn, allowing most lambs to be born in the spring when the weather is favorable.

During the breeding season, ewes have an estrous cycle of 21 days, but this can vary slightly from individual to individual. The duration of estrus, or standing estrus, also varies from individual to individual. The estrus period typically lasts 18 to 24 hours, but can last considerably longer. At the beginning and end of the breeding season, ewes may experience silent heat, a state of ovulation without estrus. In other animals, this is due to insufficient estrogen in the blood during estrus.

Ram odor plays a significant role in sexual behavior because it serves as a medium for stimulating ewes. Through conditioning and prior experience, the ram's scent triggers a series of responses in ewes that facilitate courtship and mating, such as rubbing the ram's neck and body against the ram and standing still to receive his advances. During the mating season, rams exhibit distinct and complex behavioral patterns between the two sexes. Rams can become aggressive and strive to achieve and maintain their position as the highest social rank. During the mating season, rams are extremely active and noisy, constantly guarding ewes in estrus and intruding rams. Rams often sniff ewe urine and extend their heads and necks, curling their upper lips in a "flehmen" posture, seeking out olfactory and gustatory stimulation from estrus ewes. Upon identifying an estrus ewe, rams will follow her and attempt to isolate her from the flock. Once a ewe is separated from the flock, the ram will scratch the ground around her, displaying masculine behavior. He will then frequently bleat with a hoarse voice and constantly stick out his tongue, demonstrating highly excited pre-mating behavior. He will then sniff and rub the area around the ewe's vulva with his nose, intermittently rubbing the ewe's side. Once the ram mounts the ewe, mating is accomplished through repeated thrusts of the hindquarters and the insertion of his penis. If the ewe has fully accepted the ram and has sexual experience, she will stand still and accept the ram's mounting and mating. If the ewe refuses the ram's mounting or even runs away, the ram will be unable to mount or mate. Therefore, if the sexual behavior of rams and ewes in the flock is not compatible, it may become a potential reproductive problem.

Maternal Care Behavior: As far as birth is concerned, expectant ewes are often isolated from the flock. After the lamb is born, the ewe licks the fetal membranes and fluids clean, and may even eat the placenta. This licking has a systemic stimulating effect on the lamb, and this stimulation can even be achieved by ranchers wiping the lamb with a dry cloth or straw. After giving birth, ewes typically emit brief, low-frequency bleating calls to call their lambs. If a stranger lamb approaches, the ewe will push it away.

Sustained contact between ewe and lamb, through sniffing and licking, is essential for establishing a strong bond and imprinting between mother and lamb. If a lamb is separated from its mother immediately after birth but returned to its mother within two hours, the mother will still accept it. However, if the lamb is returned more than two hours later, the mother may not accept it, and if it is returned more than three hours later, the mother will definitely not accept it. Tricks such as immobilizing the ewe or dousing the lamb with her scent can force her to accept the lamb, but this process is time-consuming, sometimes taking up to ten days to fully establish acceptance. In sheep flocks, surrogate ewes can even accept a stranger lamb after only a brief contact of about ten minutes, establishing this bond primarily through olfactory cues.

Protection (care) behavior: When lambs are captured, restrained, or injured, they emit a high-pitched wail, signaling their distress. This wail is recognizable even to inexperienced handlers. Adult sheep also bleat when isolated from the rest of the flock. In other words, when sheep from different flocks mix, they often create a rumble as they move, and these noises signal the location of fellow flock members.

Cooperative Behavior (or Resistant Behavior): When rams are kept together, they butt each other's horns to establish their pecking order within the flock. When sheep are mixed together, they butt each other's heads. Goats, on the other hand, first stand about 4 to 6 feet apart, then step back, angle their bodies toward each other, and then raise their heads to face each other. They then rotate their heads and lunge forward, forcefully butting each other downward. This difference in behavior between sheep and goats allows them to be kept together with minimal fighting.

The establishment of a social hierarchy among rams allows for the selection of dominant males to maintain flock security and provide breeding stock for ewes. Rams other than the dominant male in the flock, not used for breeding, are called peripheral males. If the dominant male in a flock is infertile or has low fertility, the flock's littering rate will be poor. However, a flock with only a few fertile males is sufficient.

During the breeding season, dominant rams are aggressive, but outside the breeding season, they may even be jostled by alpha ewes (the ewes with the highest social rank). Alpha ewes are the true leaders of the flock, and due to their rank, they produce the most offspring. Throughout their lives, ewes maintain a dominant position over their offspring. The establishment of a dominance hierarchy is often influenced by factors such as the relative age of the sheep, their fighting ability, and whether they have horns. Horned ewes may even rank higher than hornless rams. Overcrowding and small housing areas promote the development of a dominance hierarchy due to increased competition for food and space.

Although the composition of a flock may change due to factors such as the birth of newborns, death, and maturation, once a dominance hierarchy is established, it can typically last for several years. When a new animal joins the flock, aggression often occurs within a short period of time to establish its position within the flock. When sheep fight, it is usually one-on-one, never a group-on-one fight.

When goats encounter an emergency, they push their front legs hard and make a sound very similar to a sneeze. The flock will move slightly in a small area and form a sparse line in front of the disturbance. If they are further pursued, the flock will tend to be dispersed. This prevents them from gathering together like sheep when attacked. This is one of the reasons why timid dogs can never be good at watching over sheep.

When grazing, lambs typically do not follow their dams, remaining in a fixed location and timidly responding to any signs of danger. This timid behavior can prevent predators from noticing the lambs and leaving them alone. Adult sheep occasionally enter a state of stress when faced with danger or threat. This response, similar to that of kangaroos, was first discovered by Russian scientist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov , who pioneered traditional conditioning experiments with dogs. Pavlov believed that the goat's conditioning was related to a suppression of its natural self-protection impulses. This unique behavioral response was replicated in 1961 at Cornell University, Duke University, and the Muscle Research Institute at the Woods Hole Fish Biology Laboratory in Massachusetts. The results showed that goats exhibited less stress when water was restricted. In breeding, this response is thought to be genetically controlled, but current knowledge is limited.

Imitative Behavior: Goats, like other farm animals, exhibit social facilitation behaviors that are induced by the shared stimulation and security of the flock , allowing individuals to maintain optimal feed intake, growth, and health.
When sheep are herded, they typically follow the first sheep, with the rest of the flock following closely. An older ewe, usually leading the pack, selects a grazing spot and leads the flock there. The rest of the flock slowly gathers and follows. As the lead ewe moves forward, the rest of the flock follows in a sequential pattern, though unlike sheep or cattle, which often huddle together in front, the entire flock follows.

Sheep typically maintain contact with each other through vision. When grazing, individual sheep look up and around every few steps. This allows them to understand the relative positions of other sheep and to determine if they are in danger. Therefore, maintaining visual contact with other sheep is crucial for goats. When sheep visually detect being isolated from other sheep, they can become panicked. Therefore, if a sheep must be separated from the flock for reasons such as injury, birthing, or medication, it is best to place it within visual range of the flock.

Imitation behavior also occurs between different species of animals, such as sheep and goats. Because goats are more independent, they often quickly become leaders in mixed flocks. This benefits sheep farmers, as they can teach goats to seek them out when needed. Other sheep or flocks then imitate their behavior, reducing the time and effort required to gather or disperse the flock. Goats that can guide sheep to slaughter on a farm are called Judas goats.

Shelter-Seeking Behavior: Goats are generally quite hardy animals, well-adapted to both hot and cold weather, provided they are provided with shelter. Goats dislike rain, so before the first drop of rain falls, they often seek shelter under the nearest available shelter. Perhaps due to evolutionary reasons, goats also dislike puddles and muddy areas, avoiding wet areas as much as possible, thus reducing their risk of parasite infection. This is a valuable lesson to learn in goat management. While heat is not a major problem for most goats, excessively high temperatures can cause stress, leading to reduced milk production, weight loss, and even increased aggression within the flock.

Goats living in hot, dry, and treeless areas have an interesting adaptation known as shelter-seeking behavior. During the hot midday heat, when it would seem preferable for the goats to disperse individually, they instead gather together and jostle each other. This clustering occurs when the goats' ability to dissipate heat is lower than their ability to absorb it. The purpose of this clustering is to reduce their absorption of both direct and reflected solar energy. In the midday heat , the lack of shade or shelter prompts the goats to develop this unique shelter-seeking behavior to cope with the challenging conditions. This clustering and jostling also occurs in extreme cold or to repel flies.

Exploratory Behavior: Goats are naturally curious, especially young goats. When encountering something new or unfamiliar, their initial reaction will be to dodge or run for a short distance, depending on the degree of novelty, before turning to face the object. This exploratory behavior is most likely to occur when the object suddenly appears, causing panic in the flock. For example, an animal suddenly jumping out from hiding in the grass, or a person suddenly entering the pasture, can both trigger this reaction. Once the goat turns around, all senses are directed toward the distraction, and it quickly raises its head, focusing its eyes, nose, and ears on the distraction. If the distraction poses no further threat, the goat will cautiously move forward, followed by other goats, and eventually the entire flock will slowly move toward it. If the threat reappears, the goats will typically scatter and prepare to flee. The dominant male sheep usually approaches the threat first to search for it, but sometimes the dominant ewe makes the initial contact. Because young animals are more curious, lambs' exploratory responses are often bolder and more intense. This natural curiosity, combined with their smaller size and greater agility, results in unique movements and gestures. As lambs reach adulthood, their exploratory behavior gradually decreases due to natural maturation and accumulated experience. However, goats still rank among domestic animals in terms of risk-taking, adaptability, and exploratory behavior.

Feeding of lambs: 1. Feeding methods: (1) Natural lactation: lambs are fed by the ewe from birth until they are weaned. This method is generally used more often for meat goats. (2) Natural lactation and artificial feeding: lambs are fed by the ewe for colostrum for three to five days after birth, and then the lambs are separated from the ewe and fed with artificial milk substitute until they are weaned. This method is rarely used. (3) Artificial feeding: lambs are separated from the ewe from birth and fed with colostrum for three to five days, and then fed with artificial milk substitute until they are weaned. This method is generally used for dairy goats. 2. Artificial feeding methods: including milk bottles, shallow trays, multi-nipple feeding devices, multi-bottle feeding devices, tubular nipple feeding devices and fully automatic feeding machines. 3. Key points of feeding management: (1) The importance of colostrum: Colostrum contains high amounts of vitamin A and has a mild laxative effect that can help with the excretion of meconium. It also contains rich immune antibodies that can improve the disease resistance and growth rate of lambs. Therefore, newborn lambs must be fed colostrum, and the earlier they are fed, the better. (2) All feeding utensils must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before and after feeding to avoid digestive disturbances or diarrhea. If an automatic breastfeeding machine is used, the pipe system should be cleaned once a day. (3) Appropriately prepare substitute milk and feed it in a warm state. The ratio of milk powder to warm water is about 1:7-8, and the milk temperature for feeding is about 38-39℃. (4) The feeding time should be regular, and the number of feedings can be gradually reduced from five to six times a day at birth to two to three times a day at two weeks of age, and then gradually reduced to once a day before weaning. (5) Provide creep feed and green grass or hay to lambs as early as possible, and wean lambs early depending on their development to reduce feeding costs. Creep feed: It can be a mixture of cereals and minerals, or commercially available complete formula feed can be used directly. (6) Related management work such as numbering, dehorning, castration or removal of scent glands should be completed as early as possible before lambs are weaned to save feeding space. (7) Avoid overfeeding or underfeeding, which may cause excessive obesity or malnutrition, or cause digestive problems, thereby inhibiting the growth of lambs.

The formula of self-prepared creep feed is as follows: 13.6 kg crushed yellow corn, 9.1 kg crushed oats, 4.5 kg crushed barley, 13.6 kg bran, 4.5 kg soybean meal or flaxseed meal, 0.5 kg salt, and the crude protein content is about 18-20%.

Weaning time: generally one and a half to three months old.

Feeding guidelines for lambs: (1) From birth to three days old, only colostrum is fed, with milk fed 4-5 times a day, each time about 114-227 ml. (2) From three days old to one week old, whole milk or milk substitute is fed, with milk fed 4 times a day, each time about 227-284 ml. (3) From one week old to three weeks old, whole milk or milk substitute, creep feed, hay, drinking water, salt are fed, with milk fed 3 times a day, each time about 284-454 ml. Other foods are optional. (4) From three weeks old to two months old, whole milk or milk substitute, creep feed, hay, drinking water, and mixed minerals are fed 2 or 3 times a day, with a total daily amount of about 1.8 kg, of which creep feed is limited to 0.5 kg per day. (5) For children aged 2 to 4 months, the diet consists of whole milk or milk substitute, creep feed, hay, drinking water, and a combination of minerals. The dosage is approximately 0.5-1.0 kg twice daily. (6) For children aged 4 months to 1 year, the diet consists of growing season feed, hay, drinking water, and a combination of minerals. The dosage is approximately 0.5 kg twice daily. Other foods are ad libitum.

Feeding in the early stages of pregnancy: The feeding of ewes in the early stages of pregnancy can be done in the same way as for adult sheep. There is no need to increase the amount of concentrate feed. However, attention should still be paid to the quality of the pasture, clean drinking water, the supply of comprehensive minerals, and moderate exercise.

Feeding at the end of pregnancy: (1) During the last four to six weeks of pregnancy, 70% of the fetal development is completed at this time . Therefore, pregnant lactating ewes must have a dry period of four to six weeks to promote fetal development and allow the ewes to store appropriate nutrients in preparation for the next lactation period. (2) At the end of pregnancy, the ewes should be provided with good quality pasture, such as alfalfa combined with Bermuda or Timothy pasture as much as possible ; and when legume pastures such as legumes are used as the only source of forage, because legumes have a high calcium content, they should be replaced with Bermuda or Timothy pastures at least three weeks before delivery, or the amount of alfalfa fed should be reduced and supplemented with some Bermuda or Timothy pasture to reduce the occurrence of milk fever. (3) Depending on the physical condition of the ewe, the amount of concentrate fed should be adjusted as appropriate. If the ewe looks thin and has a low body weight, the daily concentrate feed should be increased to 0.5-0.8 kg. (4) Provide clean drinking water and mineral-rich salt bricks for the ewes to eat freely. (5) Provide sufficient space or exercise grounds for the ewes to exercise moderately. (6) Two weeks before the expected date of delivery, a mixture of equal amounts of table salt and dicalcium phosphate should be prepared for the ewes to eat freely to avoid milk fever. (7) Four to five days before delivery, the amount of concentrated feed should be reduced and replaced with a mild laxative feed such as bran. In addition, the grass fed should be as short as possible to facilitate digestion and help smooth delivery.

Feeding Lactating Ewes: The nutritional requirements of lactating ewes must cover all their needs for maintenance, activity, and lactation to meet their normal lactation needs. Improper feeding of lactating ewes will not only affect milk production but also reduce their disease resistance, reproductive rate, and future lactation capacity. Whenever possible, provide lactating ewes with high-quality forages, such as alfalfa, Bermuda grass, and Timothy . A mixture of grasses and legumes is preferred. For example, a mixture of alfalfa with Bermuda grass or Timothy grass is better than feeding only one forage. Some legumes contain high levels of phytoestrogens, acting as natural contraceptives. Therefore, if legumes are the only forage available and reproductive performance is poor, the ewes should be carefully investigated or replaced.

The amount of concentrate fed should vary depending on the amount of milk produced and the stage of lactation. In early lactation, give the ewe one kilogram of concentrate for every four kilograms of milk produced. As lactation progresses, gradually increase this to one kilogram for every three kilograms of milk produced and one kilogram for every two kilograms of milk produced. By the end of lactation, the amount of concentrate fed should be adjusted to one kilogram for every three kilograms of milk produced and one kilogram for every four kilograms of milk produced. The crude protein content of the concentrate can be adjusted based on the quality and type of forage, but is generally around 12-16%.

Clean drinking water and mineral-rich salt bricks should be available to the ewes as they please. Sufficient space or exercise areas should be provided to allow the ewes to exercise moderately.

Lamb Care from Birth to Weaning: The choice of lambing method depends on flock size, labor availability, and personal preference. Natural nursing is generally the most common method, but artificial feeding also includes bottle feeding, tray feeding, and automatic feeding machines. 1. Natural nursing: Lambs nurse from their dams, feeding small, frequent meals, saving labor, but can be more challenging to manage during weaning. 2. Bottle feeding: This method is more labor-intensive, but requires more care and is easier to manage after weaning. 3. Tray feeding: This method is more labor-intensive than bottle feeding, but requires training, and the lambs often lose weight during training. 4. Automatic feeding machines: This method can save considerable labor in larger flocks, but the ideal milk temperature is 35 °C, limiting the amount of milk the lambs consume at any one time. Small, frequent feedings can be used to increase the lambs' digestibility and reduce digestive disturbances. Excessive milk intake can increase the risk of diarrhea.

When feeding lambs with milk substitutes or artificial milk, since milk substitutes often use whey instead of skim milk, and whey has a high lactose content, it is more likely to cause diarrhea and bloating in lambs. Therefore, milk substitutes are best used on lambs over two weeks old or mixed with other milk powders in equal amounts. The concentration of milk substitutes should be appropriate, not too thick or too thin. When switching to milk substitutes, a gradual approach should be adopted, and a complete change should be made over several days.

Lambs over two weeks of age should be fed short-cut hay or grass to promote rumen development. Lambs over four weeks of age should be fed crushed concentrates or cereals containing 14-18% crude protein to accelerate their physical development. The weaning time of lambs should be determined based on their physical health, weight, and age. Generally, weaning is between two and three months of age, when the lamb weighs approximately ten to fifteen kilograms. Horn buds should be removed between three and fourteen days of age, but the lamb's physical condition and the growth of the horn buds must also be considered. After removal, the horn buds should be sprayed with fly repellent or iodine solution to prevent inflammation or infection. Various vaccinations can be given between three and four weeks of age. Male lambs intended for fattening should be castrated between two and four years of age to promote growth and reduce sheep odor and hygiene issues.

Management of lambs from weaning to breeding: (1) Provide high-quality legume and grass forage, and supplement with an appropriate amount of concentrate to promote normal physical development. (2) Provide adequate minerals and vitamins. (3) Provide appropriate exercise. (4) Regularly trim hooves and deworm. (5) Maintain a clean, sanitary, dry, well-ventilated sheep shed, and disinfect regularly.

Management of pregnant ewes: 1. The gestation period of ewes is about 150 days. The expected date of birth can be estimated based on the breeding date. 2. The most commonly used methods for diagnosing pregnancy in ewes are as follows: (1) Repeated estrus: If the ewe comes into estrus again 21 days after breeding, it means that the ewe is not pregnant; otherwise, it means that the ewe is pregnant. (2) Rectal and abdominal palpation: Used 70-110 days after breeding. (3) Abdominal wall palpation: Used after 110 days after breeding. (4) Ultrasound examination: It can be used for early diagnosis around 60 days of pregnancy. (5) Blood or milk progesterone concentration test: It can be used for early diagnosis. 3. Infectious reproductive tract diseases are rare in ewes, and goats are also more resistant to Brucella abortion. 4. During the last 1.5-2 months of pregnancy, ewes should be dried off and should pay attention to balanced nutrition, moderate exercise, stop feeding alfalfa hay or alfalfa pellets, and supplement with dicalcium phosphate to reduce the occurrence of ketosis and milk fever. 5. Management focus of pregnant ewes: (1) Early pregnancy - the first three and a half months, still follow the management method of general sheep. (2) Late pregnancy - the last one and a half months, pay attention to their post-natal care needs to maintain the health of the ewe and the development of the fetus. (3) Stop feeding alfalfa hay or alfalfa pellets in the late pregnancy. (4) Supply clean drinking water and supplement trace minerals. (5) Give moderate exercise. (6) Provide deworming and hoof trimming. 6. Signs and care of pregnant ewes approaching delivery: (1) When the ewe is approaching delivery, the udder will swell, the ligament near the base of the tail will relax, and the vulva will be extremely swollen. (2) 8-12 hours before delivery, the cervix begins to contract and discharge mucus that sticks to the back of the body. When the water bag appears, the lamb will be born in a short time. (3) The ewe should be observed during delivery so that timely assistance can be provided if necessary. (4) The ewe should be allowed to give birth in an individual pen to avoid being disturbed by other sheep, because if the ewe is disturbed during delivery, she may refuse to take care of the lamb. If the ewe starts to lick the lamb after delivery, it means that she should take care of the lamb. (5) The umbilical cord of the lamb after delivery should be soaked in iodine solution and tied with silk thread to prevent inflammation or infection of the umbilical cord. (6) The lamb should be fed colostrum as soon as possible, especially thin or weak lambs should be assisted in suckling. (7) The afterbirth is usually discharged within 6 hours after delivery, but sometimes it may be discharged 3-5 days after delivery. (8) Within 7-14 days after giving birth, the ewe will have a dark red mucous discharge from the vulva. This is a normal phenomenon. However, if a large amount of bright red blood or foul-smelling discharge is discharged, a veterinarian should be consulted. 7. Management of pregnant ewes during the delivery and lactation period (1) One week before the ewe is scheduled to give birth, move it to a clean individual delivery room to wait for delivery, and pay attention to the ewe's delivery signs, such as swelling of the vulva and discharge of mucus, swollen udders, bleating and restlessness, etc. (2) Install a heat lamp in the delivery room, especially in winter. (3) When the ewe is giving birth, you should observe and wait so that you can provide timely assistance in case of difficult labor. (4) After the lamb is born, the mucus in its mouth and nose should be cleaned first, and then its body should be wiped dry or blown dry. (5) The umbilical cord should be soaked in iodine solution, and then about 7-8 cm should be left, and then tied with silk thread. The ligature should be sprayed with iodine solution once or twice a day until the umbilical cord dries up to avoid inflammation or infection. (6) Lambs should be fed colostrum as soon as possible to maintain their health and improve their growth rate. (7) If the ewe is a carrier of caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE), the colostrum should be sterilized at 57°C for 1 hour before feeding to the lamb to avoid the lamb being infected with caprine arthritis encephalitis. (8) To promote the health of the lamb, iron, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E or selenium can also be injected. (9) Lambs should be kept warm and the sheep bed should be kept dry at all times to avoid the lamb from contracting pneumonia, as pneumonia is the number one killer of lambs. (10) The first ten days after the birth of the lamb are the period with the highest mortality rate. The main causes of death include low birth weight, premature birth and malnutrition of the ewe during pregnancy.

Lactating Ewe Management: Lactating ewes should be fed an appropriate amount of feed based on their milk production to maintain their milk production and health. Additionally, adequate access to clean drinking water, a healthy hygiene plan, and adequate exercise are crucial. A well-produced lactating ewe can lactate for up to 305 days per year and produce one to two lambs annually. Proper management and care are essential for lactating ewes to reach their full potential.

The most important management tasks for lactating ewes include the following two items: 1. Constructing high-quality and hygienic milking equipment, such as milking machines, stainless steel milk barrels, milk storage tanks and related milking equipment. All milking equipment should be thoroughly cleaned after use, drained and kept clean at all times. 2. Adopting correct milking procedures to maintain the health of the ewe's udder and the quality of the goat's milk. The correct milking procedures are as follows: (1) Put a small amount of concentrate in the feed trough of the milking platform. (2) Wash your hands. (3) Drive the lactating ewe to the milking platform. (4) Wash and massage the udder. (5) Express the foremilk and check whether the goat's milk is abnormal. (6) Milk manually or mechanically. Usually milking is done once in the morning and afternoon, and it is best to separate them by 12 hours. However, it can be adjusted according to the labor conditions of each dairy farm, but a fixed milking time should be maintained every day. (7) After milking is completed, soak the nipples in iodine solution and wait for the nipple soaking solution to dry slightly before returning the lactating ewe to the sheep pen. 3. Drying of lactating ewes in the late pregnancy The ewe should be dried in the last 4 to 6 weeks of pregnancy. The purpose of drying is to allow the fetus to grow and develop fully and to allow the ewe's body to store an appropriate amount of nutrients in preparation for the next lactation period. 4. Control of mastitis Mastitis is a disease caused by bacterial infection of the breast, and good hygiene management is the best way to prevent mastitis. Therefore, before milking, be sure to wash your hands clean, and after each milking, be sure to soak the nipples in iodine solution. The characteristics of mastitis are fever, pain and swelling of the breast, lumps in the breast, and some discoloration of the breast. The milk is watery, dark yellow, lumpy, green or contains blood.

Occasionally, young ewes may experience hardened udders, but this is not necessarily mastitis. Sometimes, after giving birth, the condition gradually returns to normal after a period of nursing or several artificial milking sessions. If a lactating ewe develops mastitis, the milk can be squeezed out, and then half a tube of cow's mastitis ointment (antibiotic) can be pressed into the nipple, followed by gentle massage. Applying a warm compress to the udder can also be helpful. Milk from ewes with mastitis should be discarded while they are being treated with antibiotics. It can only be consumed after 3-4 days of discontinuing the antibiotics and the milk has returned to normal.

Health Management of Dairy Sheep: Commercial dairy sheep farms typically employ a closed flock model to minimize disease. Therefore, participating in shows or competitions is discouraged. If participating in a show is necessary for the purpose of selling breeding sheep, the sheep should be isolated and quarantined after the show. A three-week quarantine period is considered safe. From a disease prevention perspective, artificial insemination is preferable to importing breeding rams or transporting ewes to other farms for breeding.

Goats are naturally intelligent and will open collars and fence latches on their own. Therefore, collars and latches must be extremely secure to prevent escape and accidental access to feed or metal storage areas, which could lead to engorgement toxemia, bloating, or poisoning. Goats naturally chew fencing materials, so paint containing lead should be avoided in old pens, and new pens should avoid the use of toxic chemicals such as pentachlorophenol as a wood preservative.

Goats' tendency to climb makes fences quite challenging to construct, and poorly chosen materials can be quite expensive. Fences with horizontal bars or slats are easy for goats to climb, making them vulnerable to damage. Chain-link fences often snag sheep's front and hind legs, resulting in fractures. If fences or pen gates use upright poles, their spacing must be carefully considered to prevent entanglement or entanglement, especially for horned sheep. Consequently, electric fences are becoming increasingly popular.

Because goats and sheep are small and lack strong defenses, they are extremely vulnerable to predators. Lambs are particularly vulnerable to predators, as they lack the ability to defend themselves. Small ruminants' primary defense is flight, and tethered sheep are doomed to die when predators invade.

In certain regions of the world, soil composition can cause plant deficiencies in certain minerals, leading to poor performance or disease in goats. Therefore, veterinarians and producers need to be aware of regional mineral deficiencies. Documented mineral deficiencies that can cause economic losses in goats include selenium, iodine, cobalt, and copper. Mineral deficiencies can be addressed by fertilizing pastures, supplementing the feed with minerals, providing trace mineral salt bricks, or injecting the missing minerals. Another potential regional concern in goat husbandry is damage from toxic plants. Among the most significant impacts of toxic plants on goats are sudden death, primary or secondary photosensitization, and an unpleasant flavor in goat milk.

Veterinarians interested in goats should encourage owners to participate in regular flock health checks. When knowledgeable veterinarians are familiar with regular flock health management measures, they can readily identify potential health problems in the flock and address them appropriately to reduce future losses. Through reproductive consultation with veterinarians, owners can improve the production efficiency of their flocks through methods such as pregnancy diagnosis, estrus synchronization, and out-of-season breeding. Mastitis control, nutritional management of metabolic diseases (such as pregnancy toxemia), and prevention plans for caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) are all related to flock production efficiency. In addition, autopsies of culled animals are also an effective way to identify potential health problems in the flock.

Disease issues in lambs from birth to weaning: During farrowing, the greatest challenges to lamb survival are hypoxia, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and susceptibility to infection. Delayed or inadequate feeding of colostrum, rich in immunoglobulins secreted by the ewe, increases the risk of disease. Failure to passively transfer maternal antibodies to the lamb increases neonatal survival and morbidity, particularly sepsis in the first week after birth and pneumonia during the weaning period. Lambs also have lower levels of immunoglobulins produced through active immunization. Failure to properly handle and disinfect the umbilical cord at birth, and exposure to unclean environments, increases the incidence of omphalophebitis, sepsis, polyarthritis, and pneumonia.

Diarrhea is a common disease in newborn lambs, and many pathogens can cause diarrhea in lambs before they are two weeks old. After two weeks of age, the threat of coccidiosis gradually increases. Pneumoenteritis complex also occasionally occurs in lambs, likely due to improper care, severe environmental contamination with pathogens, and inadequate colostrum intake. Furthermore, contagious ecthyma may occur in lambs, especially in areas where it occurs or has recently been reported.

Newborn lambs should be inspected for congenital defects such as cleft palate, rectovaginal fistula, anal atresia, hydrocephalus, umbilical hernia, and ventricular septal defect. Intersex is common in goats. Beta mannosidosis is a hereditary disease in Nubian lambs. Lambs afflicted with this genetic defect should be culled or raised for meat.

Arthritis encephalitis (CAE) is a disease of concern to goat producers worldwide. Although clinically rare in lambs under two months of age, CAE is primarily transmitted through colostrum and milk from ewes, making lambs a key focus of CAE prevention and control programs. Recent lamb husbandry techniques have developed techniques to reduce the risk of CAE infection in newborn lambs .

Management measures for lambs from birth to weaning: Before the ewe gives birth, adequate preparations should be made in advance and a comprehensive emergency treatment process should be planned to reduce the loss of newborn lambs. It is very important to plan and build a clean, warm, dry, well-lit, adequately bedding, and well-ventilated farrowing pen for the ewes to give birth, and related supplies such as towels, milk bottles or iodine solution for treating the umbilical cord should also be prepared. In addition, plans for preventing and controlling CAE infection in lambs should also be planned and prepared in advance so that they can be effectively implemented immediately after the lambs give birth. The technology of using prostaglandin treatment to induce lambs to give birth at a predetermined time has been widely used, and its details can be found in relevant books.

A well-managed sheep farm should have a comprehensive sheep identification and recordkeeping system. Newborn lambs can be identified with neck collars, while ear tattooing is recommended for lambs over three months of age. Ear tattooing should not be performed too early, as the markings will expand and separate as the lambs grow, making them unreadable. Green ink is preferred, as some sheep have black skin, making black tattoos difficult to read. Additionally, the external ears of Lai Manjiao dairy lambs are very small, so the tattoos can be placed on the inside of the tail.

Lambs can be raised in separate groups, but they should not be overcrowded. Sheep pens should be designed for easy and thorough cleaning, as poor hygiene and overcrowding increase the risk of spreading diarrheal diseases . Excess rams not intended for breeding should be culled or sold as soon as possible to reduce the number of lambs and avoid increasing environmental pollution and the risk of spreading infectious diseases.

Disbudding lambs is a routine task on sheep farms, preventing harm to both sheep and humans. In the United States, purebred goats with horns are not permitted to participate in shows. Lambs are typically dehorned between 3 and 14 days of age, but the timing varies depending on the breed, size, and sex. Dehorning male rams intended for breeding often damages the pheromone scent glands adjacent to the horn buds, potentially reducing the ram's future breeding efficiency. For male rams intended for domestic use or pets, the scent glands are typically removed along with the dehorning.

Ewes often have supernumerary nipples, which can be removed with curved scissors during dehorning. However, if the function of the supernumerary nipples cannot be confirmed, removal should be delayed. While wattles can be pinched or bitten, these are rare and can be removed with curved scissors during lambing, resulting in minimal wounding. Watt removal is usually performed for cosmetic reasons.

It's best to castrate young male rams between 4 and 14 days of age, but the reason for castration should be clear. For male rams intended for meat, castration should be determined based on market demand and the age at which they are marketed, as some markets prefer intact male rams. If the market requires rams slaughtered at 8 weeks of age, castration is generally not necessary. However, if fattening is required for a longer period, castration is necessary, as the market cannot tolerate the odor of ram meat. If castrated male rams are intended for pet use, castration should be delayed until 6 to 8 weeks of age to reduce the risk of obstructive urolithiasis later in life.

The timing and timing of vaccination for newborn lambs depends on the overall flock vaccination program. If ewes are vaccinated against a disease during the dry period and newborn lambs are fed an appropriate amount of colostrum from vaccinated ewes, they will acquire protective maternal antibodies during the first six weeks of life. Because the titer of maternal antibodies decreases depending on their initial concentration, it is best to give lambs a booster vaccination at four or five weeks of age to enhance their protective effect. If the ewe is not vaccinated, lambs born to unvaccinated lambs should be vaccinated within the first week of life, with additional booster vaccinations after a certain period, depending on the vaccine type. During the first week of life, when active antibodies are developing, prophylactic antiserum can be administered concurrently with a bacterin-toxoid vaccine to enhance protection. Products such as tetanus antitoxin and Clostridium perfringens type C and type D antitoxins are commonly used in lambs. While the vaccines required for lambs vary by region, globally recommended vaccines include tetanus and Clostridium perfringens types C and D. The tetanus vaccine is also widely used in lambs. After the initial vaccination, all lambs should receive a booster shot ; subsequent vaccinations are only required in lambs, as adult lambs already have persistent antibodies. Lambs should not be vaccinated too early, as maternal antibodies may interfere with their immune response.

Vaccinations for paratuberculosis, foot and mouth disease, and rinderpest are administered based on the needs of the national disease prevention program. Vaccines for anthrax, blackleg, leptospirosis, and rabies are administered based on regional needs. Vaccinations should not be administered arbitrarily, especially when they are live viruses that are not specifically designed for sheep. For example, in the United States, live intranasal infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) vaccines are commonly used to control respiratory diseases in sheep, but their effectiveness is not documented. Nutritional muscular dystrophy can develop in sheep from selenium-deficient soils; this condition can be treated with intravenous vitamin E and sodium selenite.

The timing of weaning lambs varies depending on the feeding system and management methods, and can be as early as 6 weeks of age or as late as 12 weeks of age. If milk feeding is not an option, lambs should be fed hay and concentrate as early as possible to promote rumen development. Abrupt weaning lambs before they are fully adapted to dry feeds can lead to indigestion, bloating, and possibly polioencephalomalacia.

Disease issues in lambs from weaning to breeding: Coccidia and pneumonia are the primary problems during this period, especially when housed. Regarding coccidia, the transition from milk to solid feed encourages lambs to ingest more coccidia eggs. Regarding pneumonia, after eight weeks of age, the gradual decline in maternal antibodies, coupled with the stress of weaning, makes lambs more susceptible to respiratory infections. During their first summer of grazing, lambs are highly susceptible to gastrointestinal parasites and lungworm infections because their digestive and respiratory tracts are not yet fully developed. The severity of these parasitic infections depends on the concentration of parasite eggs in the pasture, the stocking rate , climatic conditions, and other factors. Overfeeding lambs with concentrate feed between eight and 16 weeks of age can lead to recurrent enterotoxemia . Furthermore, progressive limb paralysis caused by infection with the neuroarthritis encephalitis (CAE) virus is also common.

Management measures for lambs from weaning to breeding: When keeping lambs in pens, it is crucial to maintain the integrity of the pen and feeding system to reduce the incidence of pneumonia and coccidiosis. Even farms with excellent feeding practices can experience clinical symptoms of coccidiosis. Therefore, in addition to maintaining good farm hygiene, it is essential to add anticoccidial drugs to the feed or drinking water.

Currently, there is no vaccine available to control respiratory diseases in lambs. In affected countries, the use of vaccines against mycoplasma pneumonia is increasing. In countries where vaccines for caprine brucellosis have been developed , lambs are typically vaccinated between three and eight months of age.

Regarding parasite control in pastures, pastures used for lamb grazing should be closed for at least one year and should be grazed separately from adult sheep whenever possible. Lambs should be given broad-spectrum anthelmintics before grazing, and fecal samples should be collected during the grazing season to monitor parasite egg concentrations. Contact anthelmintics may also be used as needed.

Once weaned, spring lambs should be fed appropriately to maintain their health and reach a suitable weight for breeding by summer of the same year, allowing for successful farrowing the following year. In North America, for example, target weights of 70 pounds by seven months for larger breeds such as the Saanen , Alpine , and Nubian , and 60 pounds by seven months for smaller breeds such as the Lamancha and Toggenburg . At three months of age, male and female lambs should be housed separately to prevent unintended breeding. Prior to breeding, all lambs should be carefully inspected for any intersexed lambs.

In temperate regions, goats are seasonal breeders, with their estrus cycle triggered by shortened daylight hours. A common area of interest is manipulating endocrine changes to induce estrus in goats, thereby achieving year-round reproduction. If goats can reproduce year-round, this significantly helps maintain a balanced milk production and sales. During the normal anestrus season, there are two methods for inducing estrus in new ewes and older goats: supplementation with fertilizing hormones, and control of daylight duration through penning and artificial lighting.

Disease Problems in Bred and Dry Doe Ewes: The primary concerns for this flock are pregnancy toxemia and abortion. False pregnancy is common in goats, but can be diagnosed by ultrasound or spontaneous uterine fluid release without the presence of a fetus or placenta. Obese ewes are at increased risk for pregnancy toxemia during the dry period, vaginal prolapse in late pregnancy, and dystocia during delivery.

Management of bred doeling and dry doe ewes : Lactating ewes are typically dry during the last two to three months of pregnancy. Since new ewes have not yet produced lambs, dryness is not an issue in late pregnancy . New and dry ewes should be properly managed to avoid obesity and receive adequate nutrients to support the rapid growth of the fetus in late pregnancy. This is crucial for preventing preeclampsia. To prevent preeclampsia, reduce the amount of grain fed during early pregnancy when milk production stops increasing . In mid-pregnancy, feed high-quality legumes and small amounts of grain or no grain . Grain intake should be gradually increased from the last two months of pregnancy until farrowing. When a flock of sheep has a problem with pregnancy toxemia, the ketone levels in the urine of new ewes and old sheep should be tested regularly with commercially available reagents or test strips to screen out sheep with early symptoms and provide appropriate treatment immediately.

There are many infectious and non-infectious factors that can cause abortion in ewes during late pregnancy. To prevent infectious abortion in pregnant ewes, no new sheep, not even rams, should be introduced to the flock once a pregnant ewe is already pregnant. Any sheep experiencing an abortion should be immediately isolated, and the area where the abortion occurred should be isolated and thoroughly disinfected. The cause of the abortion should be carefully investigated, and all fetal tissue or placenta obtained for diagnosis should be cremated. In flocks with a history of chlamydial abortion, new ewes should be vaccinated annually before breeding. The dry period is an appropriate time to vaccinate pregnant ewes, as this increases the concentration of specific antibodies in the colostrum and enhances the passive immunity of the lambs. Vaccination should be administered three to five weeks before the dry ewe farrows.

Pregnant ewes infected with gastrointestinal nematodes may experience an increase in the number of parasite eggs and eggs excreted near the time of delivery. This is a survival strategy for the parasites and increases their chances of infecting the next generation. Therefore, pregnant ewes should be given a broad-spectrum anthelmintic two to three weeks before delivery. While there are no reports of anthelmintics causing miscarriage or fetal malformations at specific doses in goats, two anthelmintics, levamisole and albendazole, are suspected of carrying these risks and should be avoided in pregnant ewes.

Disease problems in lactating ewes: (1) Mastitis is the biggest challenge for lactating ewes, and many pathogens can be isolated from lactating ewes. Mycoplasma mastitis is common in some flocks and causes serious damage to the udder. Mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus is also very expensive to treat, and it is often difficult to control if infected sheep are not strictly culled. (2) Caseous lymphadenitis occurs in sheep of any age, but the problem is most serious in lactating ewes. Lymph node abscesses are most common in the head and neck of sheep, and when lactating ewes are fixed in a neck clamp, the risk of abscess rupture increases and the disease may be transmitted to other sheep. (3) Mastitis-type arthritis encephalitis virus (CAE) infection often occurs at the beginning of lactation and is characterized by low milk production (hypogalactia) or no milk production (agalactia) and firm udders. This form of arthritis can severely reduce the milk production of ewes and has a significant impact on the production performance of sheep farms. Therefore, special attention must be paid to it and its prevention and control methods must be strengthened.

Once ewes begin lactating, infections with the arthritis-type encephalitis virus become more frequent. According to French epidemiological studies, sheep are more susceptible to infection and carpal swelling when exposed to conditions that increase their risk of joint damage. Conditions that increase the risk of joint damage include jumping on and off the milking platform during milking, poorly designed pens or feed troughs that cause repeated impacts on the carpal bones, hard flooring, and confinement or tethering that forces the sheep's carpal bones to rest for extended periods. Excessive hoof growth and improper hoof trimming are also contributing factors.

Some weight loss is normal in lactating ewes during early lactation, especially in high-yielding ewes. Lambs infected with subclinical Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (MPP) may experience clinical weight loss during the stress of farrowing and subsequent lactation. Therefore, persistent weight loss in lactating ewes should be monitored for MPP.

Gastrointestinal parasites are also a potential problem for lactating ewes when they are pastured. Although sheep's resistance to parasitic infections increases with age and exposure, it is not absolute. Clinically, even in adult lactating ewes without obvious parasitic symptoms, secondary clinical symptoms caused by parasites can significantly affect milk production.

Milk fever or hypocalcemia is less common in dairy sheep than in dairy cattle, but recurrences have occurred in some herds. Recommended management practices for controlling hypocalcemia in dairy cattle have not yet been proven effective in dairy sheep. Abomasal displacement is a common problem in intensively farmed dairy sheep, but its application in dairy sheep remains unknown.

Lactating Ewe Management: The primary goal of lactating ewe management is to maximize milk production at the lowest production cost. To achieve this, attention must be paid to the general and udder health of the lactating ewe. Feeding plans must be tailored to the lactation period and milk production of individual ewes to achieve optimal lactation. Furthermore, breeding and culling programs must be implemented to select high-yielding ewes, necessitating the continuous and thorough maintenance of relevant health and production records.

Preventive medicine for lactating ewes includes vaccinations, hoof care, and deworming. Lactating ewes should be vaccinated against enterotoxemia at least twice a year, with problematic farms requiring three vaccinations. Because a single vaccination boosts the antibody titer of colostrum in dry ewes, one or two more vaccinations are recommended during the lactation period. Vaccines to prevent abortion, such as the clostridial virus vaccine, should be administered prior to breeding.

Regular hoof trimming is crucial for maintaining a sheep's hooves. It can reduce the incidence of hoof rot, teat damage, gait disturbances, and reduced feed intake due to hoof pain. The frequency of hoof trimming depends on the sheep's level of activity, and there's a wide range of requirements. For example, sheep kept on rough or rocky ground can achieve a natural hoof trimming effect when they move around.

The feces of lactating ewes should be regularly tested for nematode infestations. A deworming program should be implemented as needed for lactating ewes, with two key points in mind. First, some anthelmintics have antifungal and antibacterial properties, which can interfere with cheese production. Second, it is important to select an anthelmintic suitable for lactating ewes and ensure proper milk collection after administration.

Maintaining the health of lactating ewes' udders requires selecting ewes with well-formed udders and good attachment, providing them with a clean and comfortable living space, properly operating milking equipment, and establishing procedures for maintaining udder hygiene during milking. When lactating ewes begin drying off, a drying ointment should be applied to the udder to prevent active mastitis. Additionally, trimming the udder and hindquarters can help reduce sediment in the milk.

For dairy goats, milk quality is a major issue. In the past, the odor and goatish taste of goat milk significantly reduced consumer acceptance of goat milk. Therefore, contact between rams and ewes should be minimized, and rams should not be kept near milking parlors or storage troughs to prevent the goatish odor from entering the milk. Lactating ewes should avoid being fed coarse feed with foreign odors, as this will impart an unpleasant flavor or odor to the milk. Proper handling of goat milk after milking is also crucial. Excessive stirring and delayed sterilization will cause the fat in the milk to break down, producing a goaty flavor. The high somatic cell count in goat milk is also a source of serious concern to the public. The somatic cell count standard for cow's milk does not apply to goat milk unless the goat's udder is infected.

When raising lactating ewes, adequate troughs or space should be provided for each ewe to feed, as much as possible, to prevent ewes with lower social status from being excluded by more dominant ewes and deprived of feed. Furthermore, dominant ewes often bully other sheep, preventing them from getting enough feed themselves. Such dominant ewes should be culled. Another issue in goat husbandry is the feeding of silage . Although this issue is still unresolved, it may be linked to listeriosis in goats .

Ram Health Management: Rams are often considered last in sheep health management plans. This reflects their unique position within the flock, signifying that overall flock health management measures are nearing completion. Ram health management plans are often abandoned due to their unpleasant odor. However, since rams play a critical role in improving reproductive efficiency and overall flock performance, ram health management plans must not be abandoned lightly.

Ram Health Issues: There are relatively few specific ram-related diseases, with obstructive urolithiasis being the most significant. While obstructive urolithiasis is more common in castrated rams, urethral stones can also cause obstructive disease in healthy rams, and the damage is similar to that seen in breeding rams. During the breeding season, rams can become quite aggressive, and fighting can cause injuries to one another. Rams can also injure humans, so staff should exercise extreme caution when approaching breeding rams. The most common problem in fighting rams is horn base fracture, resulting in profuse bleeding. This condition is caused by improper dehorning of young rams, resulting in abnormal growth of the remaining horn bud tissue, making the horn base less securely attached. While profuse bleeding is generally not serious, it is a warning sign. Therefore, dehorning of young lambs requires strict supervision to prevent the profuse bleeding associated with horn base fracture. During the breeding season, rams tend to urinate on themselves, particularly on their faces and the outside of their forequarters. This can cause urine burns and subsequent bacterial dermatitis. Applying petroleum jelly to the outside of the goat's forequarters can help prevent these injuries.

Ram Management Measures: To ensure optimal performance, rams should be conditioned and in peak condition before the breeding season. Therefore, as the breeding season progresses, they should show a noticeable trend of weight loss. This change is physiological, not pathological, and is particularly important before breeding. To maintain optimal physical condition, rams should be regularly dewormed and properly fed. Proper care of their hooves is also crucial. During breeding, the ram's riding exerts considerable pressure on the ewe's back and legs. If the ewe's hooves are not properly trimmed, the ram's riding can be painful, making it difficult for the ram to complete the ride, especially when using larger rams for breeding. Ram hoof care is often neglected because managers are often reluctant to trim rams that have a foul odor. A similar situation exists with vaccinations; rams are often under-vaccinated because they are more difficult to control.

Before breeding, rams should undergo a thorough reproductive examination, including a general physical examination, reproductive examination, semen analysis, and libido testing. These examinations should not be conducted too long after the breeding season, as the quality of a ram's semen will decline during the anestrus period. If rams are group-housed year-round, they will be more familiar with each other, and even during the breeding season, violent aggression and serious injuries will be avoided. However, introducing a young or small ram into the herd during the breeding season can cause fatal injuries and should be avoided. Trimming a ram's beard and hair can remove unpleasant ram odor, especially trimming urine-contaminated hair on the forequarters. Trimming hair is best performed before breeding. Placing rams close to ewes can help detect estrus. Rams and ewes can be induced to breed by simply being in contact through a fence, without being confined together.

Taiwan's sheep farming industry can be distinguished from its predecessor since 1985. Prior to this, it was almost entirely family-run, small-scale operations, with little emphasis on sheep breed and size. Sheep pens were simple, and the animals were kept free range. Sheep traders purchased sheep from various sheep pens, resulting in a small market for mutton. After 1985, mutton producers began importing Nubian breeders and crossbreeding them with local goats to improve their physiques. They also shifted from free range to pen-raising, increasing the use of concentrated feed, accelerating weight gain, and shortening time to market. Private producers provided a distribution channel for high-quality breeding stock through exhibitions and sales. Sheep pens were also improved, with the use of mechanical manure scrapers, saving labor costs and improving the sheep's breeding environment. Regarding mutton industry organizations, sheep farmers established the Republic of China Sheep Raising Association in 1997 to provide goat-related information. Agricultural authorities assisted various regions in establishing mutton production and marketing teams to enhance mutton producers' production techniques and strengthen their alliance production and marketing capabilities. In addition to regional farmers' associations assisting in the joint marketing of mutton, mutton auctions have been established in meat markets in Yunlin, Fengshan, and Changhua since 1988. These have fostered favorable conditions for sheep sales, including open trading, transparency, guaranteed payment, and market services. In recent years, given that imported sheep account for over 85% of domestic mutton consumption, the Taiwan Sheep Association established the Domestic Mutton Promotion Committee in 2002 to promote domestic mutton production and consumption. The recent development trend of the mutton industry has been to actively introduce new breeds of pure meat-producing Boer goats from abroad to explore sustainable development opportunities for the domestic goat industry.

Sheep husbandry and management are one of the most important factors in determining the success of a successful sheep operation. Good management can maintain flock health, improve production efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profits. However, management encompasses a wide range of factors, including sheep behavior, climate, the environment, shed construction, husbandry methods, scale, and the quality of the staff. Therefore, while there are principles for sheep husbandry and management, owners must make appropriate adjustments within their capabilities to achieve optimal results.

Goats are gregarious animals, maintaining a strong hierarchy or social status within their flocks. Males and ewes typically establish their social standing within the flock through head-to-head combat. Furthermore, a sheep's social status within the flock is influenced by age, sex, and whether it possesses horns or not. Older, male, and horned sheep have a comparative advantage. Once a social order is established within a flock, the sheep can coexist peacefully, but social status remains a dynamic equilibrium and is subject to frequent fluctuations. To minimize the dominance of horned sheep and to protect the safety of both humans and animals, it is best to avoid mixing horned and hornless sheep within a flock.

Goats are more defensive than sheep. When threatened by other animals, they emit a distinctive sneezing sound to resist. Isolated sheep often become anxious and vocalize, adding to the management difficulties.

Goats are very curious and enjoy using their mouths to inspect any novel objects around them, such as handlers' clothing, medical equipment, and record books. These items can be easily chewed or knocked over. There have even been cases of goats accidentally ingesting plastic bags or other indigestible items, causing gastrointestinal obstruction and death. Penned goats also often chew on the wood of their pens. Therefore, equipment that sheep may come into contact with should be made of sturdy materials and avoid using paint to prevent lead poisoning.

Goats prefer dry ground to muddy terrain. They would rather jump over ditches than wade through them, and when it rains, they eagerly seek shelter. Goats are agile and have a knack for climbing. Pile rocks or create rough concrete platforms in the grazing area or exercise yard of the sheep pen. This not only provides recreational exercise for the goats, but also reduces the need for regular hoof trimming. Goats are adept at jumping and climbing, easily unlocking fence latches and making them skilled escapees. Therefore, gate design, fence height, and fenceline or rail spacing should differ from those used for sheep pens.

Goats have a habit of browsing. Shrub leaves generally have higher nutritional content than grasses. Given a choice, grazing goats will skip grasses and prioritize shrub leaves. Sometimes they even stand or climb tree trunks to pluck leaves from higher trees, or even gnaw on the bark. Due to these feeding habits, goats can be used to help clear brush during wasteland development. In general grazing management, cattle and sheep can be combined for integrated grazing or the grazing order can be adjusted to fully utilize the fodder resources in the pasture. However, due to the feeding characteristics of goats, overgrazing that damages soil and water conservation must be avoided when grazing in small pastures. Goats have a strong ability to identify poisonous wild plants in pastures, but once the poisonous plants dry or wither, the goats' ability to identify them decreases.

Sheep grazing in the wild enjoy a diverse diet of over 25 plant species, but in intensive confinement, this diverse forage habit is significantly limited. Because goats have a unique habit of picking leaves, often roaming among shrubs to gather them, they spend longer foraging than sheep. Goats are very particular about the freshness of their forage, and often refuse to eat or drink if the feed or water in the trough or pasture is contaminated by sheep feces or urine. From an evolutionary perspective, this behavior serves to prevent parasitic infections.

Goats have the ability to distinguish bitter, salty, sour and sweet tastes. Since they are born with the habit of picking leaves and eating them, and leaves and bark are generally more bitter than grass, goats have a higher tolerance for bitterness than other ruminants.

Goats' feed and water intake are inversely proportional to temperature, but feed intake decreases when temperatures fall below 10°C. Penned goats often waste forage by pulling or pushing it out of the trough. Therefore, in addition to specially designed troughs, forage must be cut short before feeding. Goats spend approximately 6 to 9 hours daily feeding. Like other four-gastric animals, they ruminate, primarily at night, with each rumination lasting about one minute. Free-range goats spend approximately 28% of their daytime feeding, one-third of which is spent grazing on the ground and two-thirds on picking leaves. The remaining 50% is spent resting, 10% ruminating, and 12% traveling. For intensively housed Saanen goats, the daytime distribution is 20% feeding, 25% ruminating, 20% traveling, 11% sleeping, 14% lying down, and 8% resting. They defecate 11.2 times and urinate 8.3 times daily. In situations of urgency or alertness, the frequency and duration of rumination decreases relatively.

Goats easily adapt to water shortages because their water turnover rate is only 188 mL/kg/24 hours, similar to camels' 185 mL/kg/24 hours and far lower than cattle's 347 mL/kg/24 hours. Therefore, they are more tolerant of short periods of water deprivation than cattle. Goats are known for their mysophobia and will refuse to eat hay contaminated by fallen soil. They prefer clean, cool water. If fecal particles or urine fall into the water trough, or the water temperature rises due to sunlight, they will rather thirst than drink. This is one of the main causes of urinary stone blockage, so the water trough must be cleaned daily and clean, cool water must be provided.

Goats lift their tails and wag them when defecating, producing pellets of feces. Ewes and rams urinate in a semi-squatting position. During the non-breeding season, the penis of rams rarely, if ever, protrudes beyond the foreskin. However, during the breeding season, the situation is different: urination is accompanied by an erection and sexual activity.

Sheep in temperate regions breed seasonally, beginning in late summer and early autumn as daylight length gradually decreases, with spring and summer being the anestrus season. Ewes native to tropical regions, however, are not restricted by season and estrus occurs year-round. Rams follow a similar breeding pattern to ewes, but enter the breeding season approximately two weeks earlier. During the anestrus season, rams have lower testosterone levels in their blood and exhibit less body odor.

During the anestrus season, libido and sperm quality may decrease. However, when faced with hormonally induced estrus ewes, rams will be stimulated to mate even during the anestrus season. The behavior and body odor of rams during the breeding season are a strong aphrodisiac, which can induce obvious estrus symptoms in ewes. The body odor of rams is caused by at least two factors: (1) Rams repeatedly spray urine on their heads, necks, and forequarters. Sometimes they ejaculate urine into their mouths and open their mouths and curl their upper lips to produce the Flehmen reaction. (2) Rams have sebaceous glands on their heads, located behind the horns, which may be the source of the odor (6-Grans nonenal) during the breeding season. This substance is also likely secreted from the sebaceous glands at the base of the tail.

Sexual behavior in meat sheep includes courtship and mounting, controlled by sex hormones. When the ovarian follicles of ewes mature, they begin to show symptoms of estrus, including restlessness, bleating, tail wagging, frequent urination, redness and swelling of the vulva, mucus discharge, and attempts to mount other ewes or be mounted by others. If a ram is in the flock, the ewe will approach him, rubbing her head against his neck or body, vigorously wagging her tail, and urinating. When the ram is in its most favorable estrus phase, the ewe will frequently point her vulva toward the ram in an attempt to mate. If the ram is not in its most favorable estrus phase, the ewe will immediately run away when mounted. When the ram is in its most favorable estrus phase, the ewe will stand still for several seconds, ready to accept the ram's mating. After the most favorable estrus phase, even if the ram mounts, the ewe will no longer be willing to mate and will run away.

At the beginning or during the breeding season, rams may exhibit aggressive behavior to establish dominance. Their standing posture during a fight can injure caretakers, so rams of different sizes should be kept separately. When encountering a ewe in estrus, they will approach and follow her, placing one of their forelegs on her back to tease her. Upon smelling the ewe's vulva or urine, they will exhibit a flamboyant reflex, extending their neck and raising their head, parting their lips and exposing their teeth and gums. Occasionally, they may bellow, raise their head, or lower their neck to the ground. If the ewe is in stable estrus, the ram can successfully mate, with copulation taking only a few seconds before ejaculation. If the number of ewes in estrus is small, a single ram may mate with a ewe several to dozens of times per day. Furthermore, ram courtship is often accompanied by frantic vocalizations and rapid tongue movements. A sexually active ram often loses weight during the breeding season due to inattention to feeding and excessive breeding.

Maternal Behavior: Healthy lambs will attempt to stand approximately 10-20 minutes after birth and can stand independently approximately 30 minutes to an hour after birth. The lamb's first action after standing is to locate the ewe's teat. The ewe often rotates her body, bringing her udder closer to the lamb to help it find the teat quickly. Around 50 minutes to two hours after birth , the lamb will successfully locate the teat and begin suckling colostrum. Initially, the ewe allows the lamb to nurse at any time and allow the lamb to fully absorb the milk. However, after one to two weeks, the ewe will leave the lamb, limiting the frequency and duration of the lamb's nursing session to encourage the lamb to begin consuming solid food. While nursing, the lamb will occasionally push the tip of its nose against the ewe's udder, seemingly to stimulate milk production, and will noticeably wag its tail while doing so.

As birth approaches, ewes will become restless and scratch the ground with their front paws, engaging in primitive nesting behavior. A typical sheep gives birth to one to three litters. After the first birth, the ewe will first smell the newborn lamb and lick the amniotic fluid to protect it from the cold weather. Occasionally, the ewe will ingest the afterbirth left behind by the fetus. This behavior is repeated after the second or third birth. After birth, ewes generally display strong maternal instincts. They can distinguish between their own lambs and non-born lambs through their sense of smell, which is crucial for fostering parent-child bonding. If a non-born lamb approaches or attempts to nurse, the ewe will often immediately move away or push it away with her head. Abandoning a lamb, leaving it unattended when it attempts to nurse, or pushing it away with her head are all considered abnormal behavior.

Sheep grazing in the wild often leave the flock to give birth and hide their lambs. Even sheep kept in pens tend to try to hide when possible. If the ewe is startled, disturbed, or delays licking the lamb for more than an hour after giving birth, parent-child recognition will be impaired. If it lasts more than three hours, the lamb may be abandoned or receive less care from the ewe. Lambs grazing in the wild may be kept in a safe place for at least three days. Ewes that forage away return to nurse four to five times daily. If the ewe and lamb have a strong bond, they will be very sensitive to the bleating of the lamb if it is in danger from a distance and will immediately return to check on it. In penned sheep, a small box is set up within the pen for easy entry and exit. Lambs under one week old will also use the box as a hiding place, leaving only to nurse.

Lamb Care and Management: The average gestation period for ewes is approximately 150 days. As lambs approach their due date, it's best to isolate them in the same shed to prevent the lambs from being trampled and killed due to crowding. The delivery room should be dry, warm, and well-lit. If the lambs are born naturally and smoothly, the ewe can lick the amniotic fluid off the lambs. If the ewe shows signs of labor pains but still hasn't delivered a lamb within 1.5 hours, consult a veterinarian to determine if a dystocia is occurring. If necessary, perform an assisted birth. Before assisting, the midwife should wash and disinfect both arms and clean the vulva and surrounding area with disinfectant. After securing the lamb, insert a hand into the vagina and uterus to check the fetal position, posture, and orientation. If abnormal, push the fetus toward the uterus to create space near the vagina, making it easier to correct the fetal position. Any fetus misplaced in the uterus should be corrected to a standard position with the head above the forelimbs and the back upward. The midwife grasps the fetus's two front limbs with the fingers of one hand and, in time with the labor pains, assists in the birth of the lamb. After the lamb is delivered, the amniotic fluid can be wiped dry with a clean towel, and as much amniotic fluid and mucus as possible removed from the mouth and nasal cavity. If it is difficult to remove amniotic fluid from deep within the mouth and nose, the midwife can hold the lamb's body and head with both hands, tilting the head downward and gently shaking the fluid downward to prevent suffocation. After the lamb is born, the umbilical cord is smeared with iodine tincture or betadine. The umbilical cord is tied with iodine-soaked cotton string 1-2 centimeters from the abdominal wall. Finally, the umbilical cord and cotton string are cut at the lower end of the ligature. This prevents the umbilical cord from rotting due to prolonged moisture during the rainy season, which can lead to flies laying eggs and maggots in the umbilical cord, causing umbilical corditis, and prevents bacteria from ascending from the umbilical cord to infect internal organs.

About 30 minutes to an hour after birth, the fetus can stand on its own and begin seeking the ewe's teat to suck colostrum. Colostrum is rich in antibodies, produced by the ewe in response to environmental pathogens. These antibodies accumulate in large quantities in the ewe's milk during the latter stages of pregnancy. Lambs should consume colostrum within 12 hours of birth. This allows antibodies against large proteins in the milk to pass through the lamb's small intestine and be absorbed. This process is called migratory antibodies. After 12 hours, the lamb's ability to absorb these antibodies gradually decreases, and after 36 hours, colostrum antibodies are virtually unavailable. These migratory antibodies from colostrum protect the lamb for approximately six weeks, protecting it from common environmental pathogens. After six weeks of age, the lamb's own active immune system takes over. Colostrum also has a mild laxative effect, facilitating the excretion of meconium. It also contains a high level of vitamin A, providing sufficient nutritional support for the lamb's early years.

The fetal temperature within the ewe's body is approximately 39°C (104°F). In winter, the ambient temperature after birth is approximately 15°C (61°F). The lamb is exposed to a temperature drop of 24°C (15°F). This, combined with the damp amniotic fluid in the lamb's body, can cause significant cold stress, leading to weakness and increased susceptibility to pathogens, such as upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, or gastroenteritis. Therefore, during the late stages of pregnancy, ewes should be housed in a farrowing pen protected from northerly winds. After birth, the ewe should be checked to ensure she has licked the amniotic fluid from the lamb. If the ewe is not maternal and fails to do so, assistance should be provided to quickly dry the lamb with a clean towel or a hairdryer. If a lamb is hypothermic, it should be wrapped in a blanket or towel and placed under a heater or heat lamp. Straw bedding can be placed on the raised bed in the farrowing pen, and a heat lamp can be hung in a corner to provide the lamb with a resting and warming area. This insulation measure to protect lambs from cold stress should be maintained until the lambs are at least 2 weeks old. In the summer, when the temperature is high, the farrowing house may not need insulation equipment, but ventilation and dryness are the principles. A hot and humid environment is still one of the stress factors for lambs.

After calving, ewes begin lactating. Lambs are not producing much milk at this time. Owners can express excess milk, divide it into 100cc plastic bags, and freeze it for storage. This can last for over a year. If other ewes are unable to nurse for some reason, the frozen colostrum can be thawed in 40°C warm water and fed to the lambs, which also provides antibodies. Lambs that require artificial nursing should be fed 50-100cc of colostrum three to four times daily. After three days, artificial milk can be used instead. For example, to control infection with the caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) virus, lambs born from CAE-infected ewes should be immediately separated from the dam and not exposed to colostrum directly to prevent infection. Colostrum must be sterilized at 56°C for one hour after expression before it can be fed to lambs. If the sterilized colostrum cannot be consumed in one sitting, it can be divided into small plastic bags (approximately 100cc per bag) and frozen. Thaw at 40°C before feeding to lambs. Lambs that have consumed low-temperature sterilized colostrum should then be fed artificial milk instead of the ewe's milk until weaning to control CAE infection.

begin to learn to consume concentrate and hay on their own around two weeks after birth . Provide a creep feed containing 18% crude protein and 75% total digestible nutrients. Provide 50 grams of creep feed per lamb daily, along with free-flowing high-quality hay, to promote proper gastric development. Lambs are weaned between 10 and 12 weeks of age. Abrupt weaning of lambs that have not adapted to solid feeds can lead to digestive problems such as indigestion and bloating. To prevent creep feed from being consumed by the ewes during the creep period, construct a vertical wooden slatted fence in a corner of the sheep pen and place the crate inside, allowing only the lambs access to feed. A low-lying trough can also be installed within the fence to provide drinking water for the lambs.

Well-managed ranches should have a reliable sheep identification system for record-keeping purposes. Newborn lambs can be temporarily marked with tape around their necks or feet with a marker. Ear tags can then be attached after dehorning. Alternatively, ears can be clipped 24 hours after birth for permanent identification. If a tattoo is required inside the lamb's ear for logging purposes, it should be done after the lamb is three months old to prevent further ear growth, which could enlarge or separate the tattoo and affect future identification.

Dehorning, castration, and removal of accessory teats can be performed simultaneously on lambs between one and two weeks of age. The purpose of dehorning is to reduce injuries from fighting as the lambs grow and to facilitate management. Common dehorning methods include caustic soda or cautery sticks, dehorners, and cautery devices. However, any dehorning method has the disadvantage of causing localized damage. Dehorning with caustic soda sticks uses strong salt to corrode and destroy the growth points around the horn base, halting horn growth. Afterwards, wipe away excess fluid with a wrung-out wet towel to prevent dripping and eye injury. Mechanical dehorners use opposing sharp blades to cut the horn base and growth points, causing significant bleeding. After dehorning, apply pressure to the bleeding area with cotton dipped in ferrous chloride solution to stop the bleeding. Electric or flame-heated dehorners are most commonly used. After heating the metal tip of the dehorner to red, temporarily unplug the power cord or remove the flame. Once the tip turns black, the horn and surrounding growth points can be burned. However, incomplete burning often occurs, potentially leading to horn deformities in the future. Technically, after placing the tip of the dehorner at the base of the horn, rotate the handle in a circular motion to heat all the growth points around the base. The burning process takes approximately 7-10 seconds. Afterward, apply an ice pack to cool the area and then apply sulfa ointment. Keep flies away for two weeks to prevent maggots. Dehorning rams for breeding is generally not performed. If dehorning is performed, it is important to verify that the ram is naturally hornless. Naturally hornless rams should not be used as breeding rams, as mating with ewes may result in offspring with intersex characteristics. After dehorning, check the teats of young sheep. If there are any extra small teats around the two normal teats, these are called accessory teats and can be removed with curved scissors and coated with iodine. If it is difficult to distinguish between the primary and accessory teats, wait until the sheep grows up before deciding whether to keep them.

The purpose of castration of young rams is to prevent a strong mutton odor when they are marketed after fattening. At the same time as dehorning, non-breeding rams can be castrated surgically or by rubber banding. The surgical method involves first disinfecting the testicles and the surrounding area with iodine. Then, the scrotal skin and testicular capsule are incised at the base of the testicles, the testicles are squeezed out, the mesentery is peeled off, and the blood vessels and vas deferens are severed. The rubber band method uses a retractor to stretch a special rubber band, which is then inserted into the scrotum and tightly bound around the testicles. This causes the tissue below the band to dryly necrotize and fall off, achieving castration. In recent years, surgical castration has been performed at 4-5 months of age. This aims to extend the breeding period of breeding rams, improve the accuracy of breeding ram selection, accelerate weight gain, and reduce the risk of urinary stone blockage. However, the disadvantages of this method include larger incisions, more bleeding, labor-intensive procedures, and an increased risk of tetanus. The surgical procedure involves an assistant first placing the sheep in a side-lying position, or standing face-to-face with the sheep, holding the sheep's neck with their feet and grasping the tibiae of both hind legs with their hands to force the sheep into a standing position. After the sheep is secured, the exposed testicles are smeared or sprayed with strong iodine tincture for disinfection. An incision is made below the testicles, one on each side, down to the testicular capsule. The testicle is first expelled from one side, and the capsule is peeled away from the epididymis, exposing the vas deferens and blood vessels connecting to the testicle. These are then severed by blunt force pulling at the groin. After both testicles are removed, 5cc of betadine solution is injected into each incision, the wounds are sprayed with fly repellent, and 5cc of streptopenicillin and 0.5cc of tetanus toxoid are injected intramuscularly. After castration, unless heavy bleeding from the incised scrotum is observed, requiring veterinary attention, a small amount of blood dripping from the incision is normal bleeding from the scrotal skin. The sheep only need to be raised on a high bed for one week to avoid going down to the playground to contaminate the wound. The wound will dry up after about one week and heal in 2 to 3 weeks. When fattened to 11 months of age and sold, the scrotum will have completely atrophied and the meat will not have a strong fishy smell.

After birth, lambs should be screened for congenital defects such as cleft palate, rectovaginal gall, imperforate anus, hydrothorax, and umbilical hernia, and culled. Common diseases in lambs from birth to weaning include omphalitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, and coccidiosis. Providing a warm, dry, and clean environment and implementing proper husbandry and management methods are the best ways to reduce the incidence of lamb diseases during this period.

Growing Sheep Management: Lambs should be weaned at approximately 10-12 weeks of age or weighing 15-18 kg. Weaning should be done decisively, and intermittent feeding should not be interrupted by the lambs' cries. Lambs from the same flock that continue to suckle at each other's teats after weaning should be housed separately to prevent future lambs from turning to suck their own milk or that of other ewes. Breeding lambs should be fed high-quality hay as their primary diet during this period, supplemented with appropriate concentrates to build rumen capacity and function and prevent excessive obesity. Daily weight gain should be controlled at 0.1-0.12 kg for female lambs and 0.12-0.15 kg for male lambs .

At weaning, male and female lambs are separated to prevent uncastrated male lambs from accidentally mating, which could lead to premature pregnancy and affect the lambs' subsequent growth and development. Male lambs culled early can be surgically castrated at 4-5 months of age and fattened to be sold at 10-11 months of age. The period from weaning to 8 months of age is a critical period for the development and growth of both male and female lambs. In addition to weight gain ranking, parental performance and the lambs' physical appearance are also important factors in selecting lambs for breeding. Male lambs culled due to not being selected should be castrated immediately after 8 months of age and fattened to 12-13 months of age before being sold. This is because castrated males require 4-5 months to lose their mutton odor. Female lambs are sold when they reach 45-50 kg after fattening.

The appropriate breeding period for female sheep depends on the breed, birth season, nutritional status, etc., and breeding is carried out when the female sheep is over 8 months old and the weight reaches more than 60% of the weight of mature ewes of the breed. If female sheep are bred too early and become pregnant, it will hinder the growth and development of the female sheep, increase the chance of dystocia, reduce the twin rate, and reduce the amount of milk produced after delivery. Female sheep should not be too fat or too thin before breeding to avoid abnormal estrus or infertility. During these two periods, the ewes should be provided with concentrate feed containing 14% crude protein and 70% total digestible nutrients. One week before breeding, the concentrate feed supply should be adjusted to 0.5 kg per head per day to stimulate the ewe's ovulation.

After weaning, lambs can be dewormed for intestinal parasites between 4 and 6 months of age. Farms implementing caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) control procedures draw blood from lambs at 6 months of age to test for CAE antibodies. Lambs that test positive for antibodies are immediately isolated and culled. Lambs infected with CAE during this period are prone to developing progressive paralytic encephalitis between 8 and 16 weeks of age. Weaning is a stressful time for lambs, and they must be mindful of respiratory and digestive tract diseases. To prevent respiratory diseases, sheep sheds should be well ventilated and temperature fluctuations should be avoided to minimize stress. Proper nutrition should also be provided to enhance the lambs' resistance and reduce the incidence of respiratory diseases. During this period, lambs grow rapidly and have high nutritional requirements, so they must be careful not to overfeed with concentrate, which can cause enterotoxigenic disease. Weaned lambs, no longer protected by lactic acid in milk, are prone to coccidiosis, especially in pastures that have had coccidiosis. Complete eradication of coccidia is difficult, especially in humid climates. Weaned lambs are particularly susceptible to widespread coccidia infection, leading to severe diarrhea. Maintaining a clean and dry sheep shed is crucial to prevent coccidiosis. Rams with calcium-phosphorus imbalances in their feed, chronic vitamin A deficiency, and insufficient water intake are more susceptible to urinary stone blockage during this period. Ewes with masculine characteristics should be examined for intersex traits and culled, and their sires should be identified to determine if they are naturally hornless.

Fattening Sheep Management: The fattening program for meat sheep generally begins with early fattening between weaning and six months of age. Lambs weigh approximately 15-18 kg at three months of age. After weaning, they are fed creep feed for an additional 7-10 days before gradually transitioning to lamb feed. The concentrate feed consists of 14-16% crude protein and 70% total digestible nutrients. Average daily gain (ADG) is set at 0.15 kg, and by six months of age, they reach approximately 30 kg. After six months of age, castrated rams begin late fattening, with a concentrate feed consisting of 16% crude protein and 75% total digestible nutrients. The concentrate:roughage ratio is adjusted to 8:2, achieving an ADAG of 0.15-0.2 kg. By 11 months of age, lambs weigh 53-60 kg, making them suitable for market. During this fattening period, confinement is the primary method of feeding to reduce the energy consumption of grazing, which can negatively impact fattening. In terms of nutrition, since lambs are provided with free roughage daily during the training period, after weaning and starting fattening, the roughage intake should be very slowly reduced and the concentrate intake gradually increased, eventually reaching a concentrate to roughage ratio of 8:2. This allows the rumen to adapt to the concentrate environment and avoid rumen acidosis. This adaptation period takes about 2-3 months. To understand whether the fattened lambs are meeting the actual predicted weight gain requirements, the lambs can be weighed monthly to calculate the average daily weight gain and adjust the nutrition intake accordingly.

Feed costs for meat sheep account for approximately 60-70% of total production costs. To reduce production costs, some agricultural by-products, such as peanut vines and distiller's grains, can be incorporated into mutton sheep feed. Peanut vines are high in protein and can replace some concentrate feed, but due to their laxative properties, their use should not exceed 40% of the daily diet. Care should be taken with peanut vines to avoid the formation of aflatoxin. Brewer's grains and sorghum meal are also suitable for mutton sheep at all stages of their production, but due to storage difficulties, they can be mixed with corn to make silage for long-term use, replacing 30-40% of the daily feed intake and reducing costs by approximately 20-30%. However, due to the high phosphorus content of distiller's grains by-products, excessive intake should be considered, as it can lead to dietary calcium and phosphorus imbalances.

During the fattening of castrated rams, care should be taken to prevent bloating, enterotoxemia, and urinary tract obstruction. Bloating is caused by moldy feed or excessive consumption of fermentable feed. Concentrate should be kept fresh and dry, and moldy coarse feed should be avoided. Enterotoxemia is caused by Clostridium species, which are found in the environment and are common in the sheep's digestive tract. Normally, they pose no threat to the sheep. However, when excessive amounts of concentrate are consumed, the digestive tract becomes acidic due to the fermentation of high carbohydrates in the feed. Clostridium species multiply in this acidic environment and produce bacterial toxins. These toxins are absorbed by the intestines and enter the bloodstream, causing enterotoxemia. In severe cases, the sheep may die within 4-6 hours. Therefore, in the management of mutton sheep, a stable feed supply should be maintained to avoid sudden overdose of concentrate or allowing the sheep to steal excess concentrate to prevent the occurrence of this disease.

Castrated rams often develop urinary tract obstruction caused by stones. Stones typically develop in the bladder. During urination, stones flow with urine into the S-shaped bend of the urethra or the urethral protuberance at the urethral outlet, causing obstruction and urinary retention. This condition is associated with chronic vitamin A deficiency, a small urinary tract, a chronic imbalance of calcium and phosphorus in the feed, and insufficient water intake. In addition to ensuring the calcium and phosphorus content of the feed and vitamin A, care must be taken to ensure the cleanliness of the sheep's drinking water. Because sheep are known for their mysophobia, they tend to refuse dirty water from the trough. Therefore, daily cleaning of the trough is essential to ensure cool, clean water is provided. Preventive measures can be taken to increase the crude salt content in the concentrate to 1-1.5%. This will encourage the sheep to drink more water after consuming the concentrate, indirectly increasing urine output and reducing the risk of bladder stones. In order to reduce the consumption of exercise for fattening meat sheep, when they are kept in a pen for a long time, attention should be paid to the cleanliness and dryness of the sheep house, and the ventilation equipment should be improved to reduce the accumulation of ammonia in the sheep house, which may cause stress in the flock.

Breeding and Management: Meat-producing ewes are primarily selected for their size, excellent meat production, high reproductive efficiency, excellent maternal qualities, and abundant milk production. Since their primary function is breeding and lambing, reproductive capacity is paramount. The gestation period for ewes is approximately five months, and the uterus requires approximately 35 days to recover after giving birth before breeding again. A maximum of two pregnancies per year are possible, but due to the breeding season (September to February) and the non-breeding season (March to August), achieving two parities per year is not always feasible. A breeding plan of three parities every two years or four parities every three years is recommended, with a spacing of eight or nine months between parities. This allows the ewes three to four months to prepare for another pregnancy after giving birth, minimizing the burden on the ewes. However, if a 2-year, 3-parity breeding system is used as an example, there will be one non-breeding season within those two years. For example, if a ewe is bred in September and gives birth the following February, the next breeding time will fall during the non-breeding season in May. If a successful breeding in May and October birth is achieved, breeding can be performed during the breeding season in January of the following year . To achieve effective breeding during the non-breeding season, estrus induction can be used. A corpus luteum release device is placed in the ewe's vagina at an appropriate time. On the 9th day, 504g of prostaglandin (PGF2a) and 400 units of good horse serum gonadotropin (PMSG) are injected intramuscularly. The corpus luteum release device is removed from the vagina on the 11th day. On the 12th or 13th day, the ewe will be in estrus and receptive to ram breeding or artificial insemination. This shortened calving effect ensures the ewe's full reproduction and birthing.

There are two methods for mating ewes: natural mating with rams and artificial insemination. Natural mating simply involves placing a ram permanently in the flock, allowing it to seek out ewes in estrus for mating. Alternatively, hand mating is used, with rams being released to mate ewes once daily, in the morning and afternoon, to conserve the ram's energy. Generally, estrus is more pronounced when stimulated by a ram. To monitor estrus in the flock, rams can be released once daily, morning and evening, and inspected pen by pen along the ewe aisle. Ewes in estrus will be drawn to the rails and exhibit estrus behaviors toward the ram. Once a ewe is confirmed to be in estrus and ready for mating, the ram is brought in for mating. If different rams are used for mating during the breeding season, detailed records must be kept to ensure the accuracy of the pedigrees of future lambs.

The use of artificial insemination in goats has the following advantages: (1) the amount of semen ejaculated by rams is about 1cc, containing about 3 to 6 billion sperm, while the number of sperm required for fertilization of ewes is about 60 to 100 million. If ewes conceive through natural mating, it is a waste of sperm. If the semen can be diluted and fully utilized after collection, it can expand and accelerate the breeding and improvement of the flock for excellent rams. (2) It can save feed and management costs for raising rams. (3) There are more opportunities to choose rams, avoiding the trouble of inbreeding or frequently introducing breeding rams, which has positive value in breeding. (4) It speeds up the inspection and selection of ram offspring. (5) It prevents the possibility of reproductive tract diseases being transmitted during mating. Rams can mate naturally regardless of whether the ewes are in estrus or not, and can conceive after several matings. When implementing artificial insemination, the correct estrus stability time of the ewes should be mastered to improve the effect of conception. The onset of estrus in a ewe is generally called proestrus, lasting approximately 6-10 hours. The ewe exhibits signs such as approaching the ram, experiencing redness and swelling of the vulva, and mucus discharge, but still refuses to be mounted. This phase then enters stable estrus, lasting approximately 18-24 hours. During this phase, the ewe approaches the ram, points her vulva toward him, shakes her tail vigorously, and stands firmly, ready for mounting and breeding. During the 0-6 hour stable estrus phase, the ewe's vaginal mucus is clear. Between 9-24 hours, the mucus becomes turbid and thick, with a cloudy or creamy color, indicating the ideal time for breeding and conception. Metestrus, 18-28 hours after stable estrus, enters metestrus. While signs of estrus persist, the ewe gradually refuses to be mounted. Ovulation occurs approximately 28 hours after stable estrus. To determine whether a ewe is in stable estrus, a vasectomized ram can be used, or a belly band can be placed around the ram's chest or penis. This will prevent the ewe from being successfully bred when being ridden by the ram. If the ewe remains motionless for several seconds while being ridden by the ram, it indicates that she is in stable estrus. For ewes in natural estrus, artificial insemination should be performed 12 to 18 hours after the first stable estrus is observed. For ewes that are synchronized with a gestational hormone releaser (CIDR), prostaglandins, or serum gonadotropin (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin), artificial insemination can be performed 22 to 24 hours after stable estrus is recorded.

During artificial insemination, an assistant can stand with their legs clamped around the ewe's neck. The inseminator uses their right hand to push upward from the ewe's ischium. The assistant immediately grasps the ewe's hind shins and places their hands on her flanks, positioning the ewe on her front legs with her body at a 90 -degree angle. Alternatively, an artificial insemination rack can be used, with the ewe's neck clamped and her hind legs elevated and tied to the rear crossbar of the rack, positioning her body at a 45- degree angle to facilitate artificial insemination. The ewe should be secured as gently as possible, avoiding causing panic or stress, to maximize conception success. After the ewe is secured, the frozen semen is removed from the liquid nitrogen tank and immediately thawed in 37 °C warm water for 30 seconds. The semen tube is removed, dried, and the non-cotton-stoppered end of the straw is cut to seal it. The semen tube is then loaded into the artificial insemination gun for later use. Then, hold the vaginal speculum open and illuminate the interior of the vagina to locate the cervical opening. Insert the insemination gun and aim it at the external cervical opening. Gently and gently, move the gun back and forth and side to side, allowing it to gently pass through the cervical folds. When the gun enters the uterine body, you should feel no resistance at the tip of the gun. Then, slowly inject the semen from the straw into the uterus, completing the artificial insemination. If the insemination gun has difficulty passing through the cervix, injecting the semen into the mid-cervix can also achieve a near-ideal conception rate. Avoid forcing the gun through the cervix. Injury and bleeding will reduce the ewe's chances of conception and may even affect future fertility. Also, avoid inserting the gun too deeply to avoid injuring or puncturing the uterine horns.

stops estrus after 17 to 20 days of mating, it can be preliminarily determined to be pregnant. However, some ewes may go into estrus during pregnancy, or may be about to enter the non-breeding season. Therefore, non-pregnant ewes may not return to estrus, which may lead to misdiagnosis. 3 to 4 months after mating, pregnancy can be determined by the appearance of the ewe's enlarged abdomen and gradually fattened body. Common methods for confirming pregnancy include : (1) abdominal wall palpation, which is suitable for 3 months of pregnancy. Use both hands to circle the ewe's lower abdomen and move inward and upward. If you feel the fetus moving in the ewe's abdominal cavity, it indicates pregnancy. (2) Ultrasound auscultation is suitable for the early 35-40 days of pregnancy. Insert the ultrasound probe into the rectum along the lower side of the rectal wall to avoid interference from feces between the probe and the rectal wall. Rotate the probe about 35-40 degrees to the left and right with the probe pointing downward . Listen to the sound of blood flow in the uterine artery of the ewe. The uterine artery of the pregnant ewe expands due to the need to increase the blood flow into the uterus. When the blood flows, it will make a clear and intermittent whooshing sound. In non-pregnant ewes, the sound is weak or there is no echo. (3) Ultrasound imaging scanning is used for the 25-45 days of pregnancy. The accuracy rate can be as high as over 95% . Use an ultrasound scanner. After shaving the abdominal wall, apply gel. Place the ultrasound probe close to the abdominal wall and scan upwards. Alternatively, insert the rectal probe into the anus and scan downwards towards the uterus. The fetal image can be seen directly on the screen. In the early stages, the fetus is not yet formed and only black, hollow amniotic fluid and white, dot-like fetuses are visible on the image. From 45 to 60 days of pregnancy, the hollow amniotic fluid, fetal bones and button-shaped uterine mounds can be easily seen.

After calving, the ewe's concentrate intake can be increased to accelerate postpartum recovery and ovulation, thereby ensuring multiple births at the next breeding. From breeding until 3.5 months of gestation, the concentrate intake should be limited to approximately 0.3 to 0.5 kg per day to prevent obesity, which can become a predisposing factor for pregnancy toxemia. After 3.5 months of gestation, the concentrate intake should be increased to approximately 0.5 to 0.8 kg per day to prevent pregnancy toxemia, which can occur 7 to 10 days before birth when the uterus is carrying two or more fetuses, resulting in loss of both the ewe and the fetus.

During the middle and late stages of pregnancy, as the fetus grows, the ewe needs not only an increased nutritional requirement but also additional vitamins and trace minerals. Therefore, vitamins ADE should be added to the feed, or the ewe should be given an injection of oily vitamins ADE one month before and one week after giving birth. This supplement can improve the vitality of the lambs born later and help the recovery of the ewe's uterus after giving birth. Trace minerals can be provided by hanging salt bricks in the ewe's house and allowing the ewe to lick them, or by mixing half coarse salt and half dicalcium phosphate in a plastic basin and placing it in the barn for the ewe to feed freely when needed. This can prevent the fetus from developing rickets due to calcium deficiency, or the lambs from being less energetic due to insufficient trace minerals.

If ewes are confined for long periods of time and have limited exercise, their hooves often grow too long or become severely deformed. This, combined with an improper standing posture, can lead to foot rot or lameness, and even reduce feed intake, affecting body condition and reproductive efficiency. Excessive hoof growth can also cause scratches on the nipples or udders, causing mastitis. Hoof trimming can be done with hoof shears or tree shears. Secure the sheep's neck to the barn rail. With your left hand, grasp the ankle and lift it upward, keeping the hoof facing upward. Use the hoof shears to level the hoof sole. If trimming causes bleeding, use a soldering iron to stop the bleeding, then apply iodine, or apply pressure to the bleeding area with cotton soaked in iodine, then secure the cotton with tape. Both hooves should be trimmed to the same height. Significant unevenness can lead to hoof deformation. Hoof trimming should be done twice a year.

Confined ewes require deworming approximately twice a year, and three to four times when regularly grazing, to prevent parasitic infections. Deworming should ideally be performed when the ewes are empty to avoid stress. Some anthelmintics can cause miscarriage in late pregnancy. If deworming is necessary during pregnancy, choose the right anthelmintic carefully.

Excellent rams play a crucial role in improving the reproductive efficiency of a flock and its overall productivity. Selecting a high-quality ram requires not only considering the genetics of its parents, but also selecting one with a good appearance, body shape, and sharp, sensitive eyes. Testicles are also a key consideration in selecting rams. They should be well developed, with a large circumference and symmetry. Some height variation is normal. Testicles should be reasonably firm when palpated. If they are too firm or too soft, or contain lumps of varying sizes, they may be pathological and could affect spermatogenesis.

1.5 years old, breeding rams can perform light breeding duties with approximately 20 ewes. After 2 years of age, they begin breeding 30-50 ewes. Rams over 5 years of age may be considered for culling. Normally, breeding rams should be kept in a spacious pen or pasture to allow for adequate exercise and build strength. Rams with insufficient strength, poor hind leg support, or excessive breeding will affect their breeding ability. Before the breeding season begins, rams should undergo health, physiological, semen, and libido examinations and assessments. At the beginning of the breeding season, rams can be housed in a pen adjacent to the ewes; their body odor can stimulate estrus in the flock. Avoid using two or more rams simultaneously with the same flock of ewes during breeding, as this may lead to aggression and fighting.

During the non-breeding season, rams are fed approximately 0.5-0.7 kg of concentrate feed daily in addition to free-flowing hay. During the breeding season, additional concentrate feed may be provided depending on the individual's nutritional status. During the breeding season, some rams urinate on their chests or forelimbs. Urine stains can occasionally cause dermatitis or secondary bacterial infections. This can be addressed by shaving the chest and forelimbs. Because rams' testicles hang between their thighs, they can occasionally become injured and infected due to fighting, insect bites, or punctures from shed building materials, leading to suppuration or fibrosis, ultimately resulting in loss of spermatogenesis. High ambient temperatures can also affect testicular spermatogenesis, requiring management improvements and preventative measures.

A culling system for meat sheep breeding stock needs to be established. Ewes that are too old, do not meet the required size, have low reproductive rates, or suffer from CAE infection with swollen wrists and severe udder damage should be culled early. Female lambs retained for breeding can be selected twice at three and six months of age, with a retention rate of 25-40%. To expand the ewe herd, 40% of the female lambs can be retained annually for replacement, thereby increasing the ewe population. If the retention rate is set at 25%, 20% of the older ewes and 5% of those unsuitable for breeding for other reasons can be culled annually. The ewe population can be kept constant at approximately five years of age. The selection of rams is more rigorous, generally with a retention rate of less than 5%. A sheep identification system should be established on the ranch to facilitate management, and color zoning can also be used. Except for tattoos used for breeding stock registration or epidemic prevention purposes, ear markings and ear tags or neck tags should be consistent to avoid confusion. Pedigree information should be established for breeding male and female sheep for breeding sheep registration.

Sheep shed construction and the space provided for sheep: Due to limited and expensive land resources in China, coupled with concerns about urban environmental pollution, sheep sheds are generally built in rural areas or near mountainous areas. In principle, sheep shed planning should consider drainage and ventilation, ease of management, smooth operations, environmental hygiene, waste disposal, robustness, capital investment and recovery, and the potential for future expansion. Sheep shed size is generally determined by the scale of the herd. Sheep sheds should typically feature high roofs to reduce the accumulation of stale air. It is best to keep walls free to increase air circulation in the summer, and plastic sheeting can be used to block cold northerly winds in the winter. Sheep shed railings should be made of tungsten or stainless steel to minimize damage from gnawing. Avoid painting any objects in the shed with lead paint to prevent lead poisoning from the sheep. Raised sheep beds should be approximately 60-80 cm above the ground. The bed surface can be constructed of 1.2 x 1.2-inch wooden strips with 0.8-1.2 cm gaps, or a coarse wire mesh with 0.6-0.8 x 3 cm gaps, allowing sheep feces and urine to fall directly to the ground. An automatic manure scraper can be installed under the bed to remove feces and urine daily, saving labor on manure removal. Adult sheep on the raised bed have approximately 0.6 ping (approximately 1.2 m2) of space per head to avoid overcrowding. A play area should be located behind the sheep bed, at least equal to or larger than the raised bed. Stones or bricks can be piled in the play area to accommodate the goats' climbing habits. A feed trough can be placed at the front edge of the raised bed to protect it from direct sunlight and rain. A water trough should be located out of direct sunlight to minimize moss growth and water temperature rise. A grass rack should be placed in the play area for easy cleaning.

Sheep house cleaning and disinfection: Sheep feces and urine under the high beds in the sheep house should be scraped off daily, and waste in the playground should be swept daily to maintain cleanliness at all times. Keeping the sheep house and the surrounding environment dry is the best way to control diseases. It would be even better if the ultraviolet rays of sunlight could reach the sheep house every day. Especially for sheep farms with harmful conditions, the sheep house should be kept away from moisture to control the continued spread of coccidia. To prevent the occurrence of diseases, you can consider spraying the sheep house with disinfectant. The ranch can prepare 2 to 3 different types of disinfectant, which should be replaced every 3 to 4 months to avoid the development of microbial resistance after long-term use of the same disinfectant. The amniotic fluid and afterbirth of the ewe should be swept away after giving birth to prevent the ewe from eating them. The bedding used to keep the lambs warm in winter should also be replaced when it is wet to reduce the potential for bacteria.

Maintaining a hygienic sheep barn environment: Drainage and composting facilities around sheep barns must be carefully protected from mosquito and fly breeding and rat shelters. Besides spreading disease, mosquitoes, flies, and rats can also cause considerable harassment to sheep. To address the mosquito and fly problem in pastures, some farmers spray insecticides or hang numerous fly traps in the barns. This has been effective, killing numerous flies with poison or electrocution. However, large numbers of flies and mosquitoes still exist in the pastures. This is because these measures only address the symptoms, not the root cause. The fundamental problem lies in the conditions that allow mosquitoes and flies to breed. Clearing drains and cleaning feces and urine, eliminating the breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, will naturally reduce the number of flies and mosquitoes and effectively reduce pasture odor. Rodent control is not easy, and it is recommended to use multiple methods simultaneously and continuously, such as bait, traps, cages, and repellers, to achieve the desired effect.

Waste Treatment and Utilization: For example, an average goat weighing 40 kg excretes approximately 0.2-0.4 kg of feces and 0.9-1.8 liters of urine per day. For a farm housing 100 goats, the total annual manure production can reach 11 tons. Left untreated, this waste can cause serious environmental pollution and promote mosquito and fly breeding. The collection of feces and urine on a sheep farm depends on the construction of the sheep shed. Currently, the preferred design utilizes automatic manure scrapers, either net-type or scraper-type, to collect feces and urine. A net-type scraper features a revolving mesh surface between the raised bed and the ground, collecting fecal pellets that fall from the raised bed while urine falls to the ground below, effectively separating solids from liquids. The scraper is activated daily, and the rolling mesh collects feces and pellets into a manure trough at the rear of the sheep shed. Due to their low moisture content, the feces can be dried briefly, bagged, sold, or sent to a composting facility for composting. However, the urine that falls to the ground requires a gentle rinse, increasing wastewater volume and treatment costs. A scraper-type manure scraper allows sheep manure and urine to fall directly from the raised bed to the ground. Automatically controlled, it is scraped into a manure trough once or twice daily. The collected manure and urine is then moved to an open area for drying, bagging, and sale, or to a composting shed for composting. A composting shed requires a three-sided building with a rainproof roof. A shed capable of handling the manure and urine of 100 sheep should occupy approximately 45-50 square meters. Composting is an aerobic fermentation process, with an optimal moisture content of 65-70%. However, sheep manure only contains 50% moisture, so water must be added during the fermentation process. During fermentation, the compost temperature can reach over 70°C. To replenish oxygen and maintain fermentation, the compost must be turned every two weeks, either by a shovel loader or manually. Turning the compost causes the temperature to rise again. After about four to five turnings, the temperature stops rising, indicating that the compost is fermenting. During composting, cover the pile with plastic tarpaulin to deter flies and mosquitoes. Composting involves microorganisms breaking down undigested organic matter in feces and urine, reducing the inherent odor. The high temperatures generated during fermentation kill harmful microorganisms, parasite eggs, and plant seeds, and reduce the presence of substances in the manure that are harmful to crop growth. This allows the treated organic compost to be used directly as fertilizer for pasture or crops.

Feed and Water Provision: Sheep concentrate feed should be fresh. Whether home-mixed or purchased from a factory, it should be used within 15 days and stored in a dry place to minimize moisture. Hay should be kept away from moisture and mold, and high-quality hay should be fragrant. When increasing the amount of concentrate or changing the formula during sheep rearing, it should be done gradually to avoid diarrhea or even enterotoxemia due to poor adaptation. Sheep are known for their mysophobia and prefer clean, cool water. If their water is contaminated with feces or urine and has an odor, or if it's exposed to sunlight and moss grows in the water, or if the water temperature rises, they often refuse to drink, resulting in reduced urine output. This is a major cause of urinary stone blockage in castrated rams. Water troughs should be made of easily cleanable materials, placed away from feces and urine, and protected from direct sunlight. They should be cleaned daily to ensure a supply of cool, clean water.

Separate herd management: Sheep on a sheep farm must be separated for management purposes, including sex, size, and fatness. Because sheep breed seasonally, rams are typically managed separately from ewes. Rams are only introduced into the ewe flock during the breeding season, or bred by hand mating. Ewes are grouped separately for foaling, pregnant, and empty lambs to facilitate management. During the fattening period, castrated rams should also be separated by size and fatness to minimize competition for food.

Reduce stress: Sheep exposed to stress can weaken their immune system, rapidly reducing their resistance to external pathogens and making them more susceptible to disease. Sources of stress include sudden rises or falls in temperature, heat or cold, prolonged lack of ventilation in the barn, prolonged noise disturbances, overcrowding in a barn, sudden changes in the feeding environment, chronic nutritional imbalances, sudden changes in feed, sudden changes in management practices, startling sheep due to harassment by strangers or stray dogs, forceful driving or beating, long-distance transportation, pain from accidents, and poor post-operative care. Good management should prioritize animal welfare and adopt a reasonable, gentle, and gradual approach.

Disease Isolation: The domestic sheep farming industry is plagued by a shortage of breeding rams within the ranch, which often results in the borrowing of rams for breeding. Alternatively, when sheep are purchased from other ranches, they are immediately placed in the flock due to a lack of housing. If the purchased sheep carry diseases such as conjunctivitis, caseous lymphadenitis, suppurative lupus, arthritis, encephalitis, and coccidiosis, these diseases can spread to all healthy sheep on the ranch, impacting normal management. Therefore, properly managed ranches should maintain an isolation shed in a remote area. All sheep entering the ranch from outside must be kept in the isolation shed for at least two weeks, with their health monitored daily. Any abnormal symptoms should be diagnosed and treated by a veterinarian, and only released into the flock when all conditions are resolved.

Self-defense and epidemic prevention in mutton farms: In addition to paying attention to feeding management and maintaining nutrition, attention should also be paid to hygiene management to prevent the invasion of diseases and cause economic losses. Ranch self-defense and epidemic prevention is the most basic method of self-control of diseases and needs to be implemented continuously in normal times. The key points are as follows: 1. Epidemic prevention management: (1) Personnel management: Visitors or non-staff are not allowed to enter the ranch in normal times. Staff are also strictly prohibited from entering and leaving other ranches at will. When traveling abroad, try to avoid entering local ranches. Otherwise, after returning to the country, self-isolate for at least one week and do not enter the ranch to contact animals. (2) Vehicle control: Control the vehicles entering and leaving the ranch. Feed trucks, milk trucks, sheep trucks, etc. that need to enter and leave must be sprayed with disinfectant or passed through shallow disinfection pools. (3) Herd management: Animals should be isolated when purchased in normal times. Vaccinations should be administered as required. Animals on the farm should be vaccinated on time. Animals transported to the market for sale should also provide vaccination certificates as required. Dead animals should be collected by the chemical processing plant for chemical processing, incineration, or burial, and disinfection should be paid attention to. (4) Livestock house management: Livestock houses should be cleaned, maintained and disinfected as necessary. In the event of an epidemic, appropriate disinfectants should be used to strengthen the disinfection of livestock houses. (5) Epidemic management: If an abnormal disease is found in the ranch, the local animal epidemic prevention unit such as the county or city livestock disease prevention and control center or the township office should be notified immediately so that the epidemic can be dealt with as soon as possible. 2. Disinfection method: (1) The surface of the object to be disinfected should be cleaned first for better disinfection effect. (2) For disinfectants that are effective against general bacteria and viruses, please select them according to the instructions. For foot-and-mouth disease virus, a disinfectant that can effectively kill the virus should also be selected. (3) Other acidic and alkaline disinfectants suitable for killing foot-and-mouth disease virus are as follows: Sodium hydroxide: dilution ratio 2%, dilution method is 2 kg of alkaline tablets dissolved in 100 liters of water, but it is corrosive, so be careful; Sodium carbonate: dilution ratio 2%, dilution method is 2 kg of sodium carbonate dissolved in 100 liters of water, but it is irritating; Citric acid: dilution ratio 2%, dilution method is 2 kg of citric acid powder dissolved in 100 liters of water, but it is irritating; Acetic acid: 2 parts of glacial acetic acid solution mixed with 98 parts of water, it is irritating, but it is safe for humans and animals to contact, and is relatively non-irritating. (4) Do not use acidic and alkaline disinfectants at the same time, otherwise they will lose their effectiveness after the acid and alkali are neutralized. 3. Vaccination: Currently, the only vaccine that requires vaccination for meat sheep in Taiwan is foot-and-mouth disease. The following precautions should be taken when using the vaccine: (1) Use government-approved vaccines and do not purchase vaccines of unknown origin. (2) Strictly follow the method and dosage of vaccine use. (3) Follow the instructions of the veterinarian and administer the primary vaccination and the booster shot every six months on time. (4) Follow the instructions and pay attention to the storage method and expiration date of the vaccine. Never use expired vaccines. (5) Vaccinate according to the instructions of the veterinarian and never falsify the information.

Basic Health Checks for Sheep: When raising meat sheep, it's important to carefully observe their behavior and habits to fully understand their normal feeding habits and other behaviors. This allows for early detection of illness and prompt health checks or treatment. The average normal body temperature for goats is 39.9 °C, ranging from 38.7°C to 40.7 °C, with a pulse rate of 70–80 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 12–20 breaths per minute . Abnormalities in a goat's normal body temperature, pulse rate, and respiratory rate may indicate illness. To measure a sheep's temperature, use an animal thermometer with a 30- centimeter string and a clip attached to the rear end. First, swing the thermometer downward until the mercury column drops below 34 °C. Then, fully insert the thermometer into the anus, securing the clip to a hairy area on the back to prevent it from falling. The thermometer should be measured for at least three minutes. After removal, check the temperature indicated by the mercury column. A rise in body temperature may be affected by factors such as ambient temperature, exercise, stimulation, and age. After excluding these factors, if the body temperature continues to rise, it may indicate that the sheep is infected and ill. Body temperature can also decrease due to low ambient temperatures, old age, or nighttime measurements. The pulse rate indicates the sheep's heart activity. If it is too high or too low, attention should be paid to whether the sheep is suffering from heat stroke, bloating, other febrile diseases, or internal bleeding. The respiratory rate can be calculated by the number of times the chest and abdomen rise and fall. In cases of febrile diseases or respiratory diseases, sheep will only have symptoms of rapid, short, or difficult breathing. A stethoscope can also be used to check for respiratory and digestive tract diseases in sheep to increase the accuracy of disease diagnosis. It serves as a basic examination of the sheep's physical health.

Health management of lambs: The quality of management after lambs are born directly affects the success rate. In fact, the health of lambs after birth is related to the health status of the ewe in the late pregnancy and the care after the lambs are born. The causes of fetal or lamb death from before delivery to 28 days after delivery are as follows. In the process of raising sheep, the causes can be targeted, and the sanitary environment or feeding management methods can be improved to reduce the loss of lambs.

Prenatal death: Malnutrition in the late pregnancy of the ewe, excessive obesity, infection of the uterus or birth canal, excessive stress on the ewe caused by high temperature environment, or infection by pathogens can cause the fetus to die in the womb.

Death during childbirth: Dystocia caused by an overly large fetus, abnormal fetal position, malposition, or uterine weakness, which may result in uterine rupture or fetal death due to lack of timely assistance.

3 days after delivery : It may be due to malnutrition of the ewe or inability to provide milk due to old age ; the ewe has no milk to breastfeed due to mastitis ; poor maternal instinct or disturbed or difficult delivery, which makes the ewe unwilling to breastfeed, resulting in fetal hunger ; postpartum lambs are exposed to hypothermia due to excessive cooling or stress due to overheating ; the ewe lacks trace minerals such as iodine, selenium, and manganese, causing the lambs to be excessively weak after delivery ; accidents or attacks by wild dogs or cats, etc., can easily cause the fetus to die within a short period of time after delivery.

Death within 7 days after birth: Abandonment by the ewe, mastitis, nipple injury, unwillingness to nurse, starvation; congenital defects such as anorectal lock or cleft palate; infection leading to diarrhea, pneumonia, sepsis, or white muscle disease caused by a deficiency of trace minerals such as iodine and selenium. Death within 1 month after birth; severe parasitic infection, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and other diseases.

Ewe Health Management: Pregnant ewes not only need to maintain their own nutrition but also maintain systemic function to prevent the development of this disease. Providing the nutritional needs of the fetus is crucial. If the feed consumed is inadequate, metabolic diseases such as pregnancy toxemia and milk fever may develop . Pregnancy toxemia, also known as ketonemia or twin disease in sheep, is a metabolic disease that is common in late pregnancy. In ewes without effective prevention measures, the mortality rate can be as high as 80% . While general treatment is ineffective, management strategies can be used to prevent this disease. These include avoiding excessive obesity ; providing high-energy concentrate feed that meets the needs of the ewe and fetus for maintenance and growth during the last 45 days of pregnancy ; and providing free access to good forage or feeding small, frequent meals . In late pregnancy, avoid sudden feed changes, long-distance transportation, or exposure to sudden climate changes. Furthermore, other diseases should be prevented to prevent prolonged loss of appetite and subsequent disease. Milk fever, also known as peripartum hypocalcemia, is a metabolic disease that is common in ewes around the time of parturition. Symptoms include decreased milk production, poor appetite, lethargy, and occasional rigor mortis. The ewe's blood calcium concentration drops from a normal 9-10.5 mg/dL to 5 mg/dL . Treatment can include a jugular vein injection of 50-100cc of 25% calcium borogluconate. The injection should be slow to prevent cardiac shock, which can quickly improve symptoms. Prevention involves limiting the ewe's calcium intake to a low-calcium diet from 30 days before parturition until delivery, withholding alfalfa to maintain a negative calcium balance and activate calcium-releasing hormones. Abortions in pregnant ewes can be caused by both infectious and non-infectious factors. To prevent abortions caused by infectious factors, strict farm self-prevention and epidemic prevention principles should be adhered to. Newly purchased, unquarantined sheep should never be mixed with pregnant ewes to avoid introducing pathogens that cause abortion. Non-infectious causes of abortion should be carefully considered, including excessive driving or crowding, long-distance transport, collisions or fighting between sheep, prolonged noise exposure, inhalation or ingestion of large amounts of mold spores, and the misuse of medications containing steroids, estrogen, or insect repellents. When abortion symptoms appear, in addition to immediately isolating the aborted ewe, owners should wear plastic gloves and place the aborted fetus and place the afterbirth in a double plastic bag. These should be promptly sent to an epidemic prevention unit for inspection. Aborted fetuses and afterbirth that do not require inspection should be buried or incinerated.

Regular Infectious Disease Testing: Goat tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium spp. and is a notifiable zoonosis. It can be transmitted through droplets, contaminated milk, feces, urine, feed, drinking water, and skin wounds. Severe cases may present with symptoms such as persistent dry cough, dyspnea, enlarged lymph nodes in the head, neck, or abdominal mesenteric region, intermittent diarrhea or constipation, enlarged lymph nodes in the udder, and granulomatous skin ulcers. Regular testing can help detect TB early before symptoms appear, allowing culling. Currently, livestock disease control centers across Taiwan regularly test dairy sheep annually using intradermal tuberculin injections at the base of the tail. Positive sheep are immediately isolated, restricted from movement, and culled. Contaminated farms use intradermal tuberculin injections at the side of the neck, testing every three months. Regular testing resumes only after all sheep have tested negative three times in a row. Because this disease is a zoonosis, farms can apply for regular testing to protect the health of both humans and animals.

Prevention and Treatment of Parasitic Infections: Sheep of all ages can be infected by parasites, which can affect their growth and weight gain, causing economic losses to sheep farming. Young sheep are particularly vulnerable. Common parasitic infections in sheep include contortus, intestinal worms, trichinella, and tapeworms, causing nutritional deficiencies, anemia, diarrhea, weakness, stunted growth, enlarged abdominal girth, and a rough, dull coat. Antiparasitic drugs such as Levamisole ( Levamisole, Libiq ) and Ivomectin ( Ivomectin ) are the most commonly used for treating parasites, as they are effective and have low toxicity. Levamisole may cause miscarriage when used in ewes during late pregnancy, so its use should be avoided during this period. Ivomectin not only eliminates internal parasites but can also treat external parasites such as scabies. These two drugs are ineffective against tapeworms; Mebendazole is an alternative. Parasitic infections can be prevented through management measures. For example, sheep should not be grazed after rain or during summer morning dew to prevent the hatching of parasite larvae from being ingested by the sheep. Confined sheep should be dewormed twice a year. Grazing ewes are more susceptible to internal parasite infections and should be dewormed approximately three to four times a year as needed.

Breeding Season: Goats are a type of livestock that breed seasonally. In temperate regions, the breeding season for dairy goats begins in late summer and early autumn, when daylight length gradually decreases, and lasts from approximately August to February. Deep anoestrus occurs in spring and summer, from March to July, while August and February are transitional periods. The length of the goat breeding season varies depending on latitude, breed, and nutritional status. For example, breeds of goats from equatorial or tropical regions have no distinct breeding season year-round. Temperate breeds migrated to the tropics experience a gradually longer breeding season. Nubian goats, due to their tropical ancestry, have a longer breeding season than Swiss breeds such as the Saanen, Albain, and Toggenburg. Tropical goats are primarily herded, and seasonal forage shortages and high temperatures can significantly limit their reproductive activity, but this is unrelated to seasonal changes in daylight length. Taiwan is located in the subtropics, and the temperate dairy sheep breeds raised there, such as the Saanen, Albain, and Toggenburg, have mostly adapted to the local natural environment. As a result, the sheep do not experience severe estrus in spring. However, due to the influence of latitude, most sheep still show varying degrees of estrus in spring. For economic production, appropriate application of artificial regulation techniques to induce estrus is still necessary.

The primary factor affecting seasonal reproduction in goats is the seasonal variation in daylight length (photoperiod). In temperate regions, daylight length varies significantly year-round. As summer transitions into autumn, the shortened days and long nights stimulate light, which is transmitted via the goat's optic nerve to the brain, promoting the secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland. Melatonin, in turn, stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete gonadotropin, ultimately stimulating gonadal activity. This leads to ovulation and estrus in ewes, while rams experience a sharp increase in plasma testosterone levels. Other effects, such as spermatogenesis, body odor, and libido, also increase significantly.

Puberty: Puberty, or sexual maturity, occurs between 5 and 7 months of age in female sheep and between 4 and 6 months of age in rams, when they reach at least 40% of their mature body weight. Puberty is influenced by the breed, nutritional status, and season of birth. For example, early-maturing breeds like Pigmy or Formosan goats may see females puberty as early as 4 months of age, while larger dairy sheep like Sanen may not puberty until after 7 months of age. Puberty can occur early in female sheep raised in the presence of mature rams, or in the presence of estrus ewes in the presence of rams, due to sexual stimulation. To prevent unwanted pregnancies, ewes must be completely separated until 5 months of age.

Estrus and estrous cycle : Signs of estrus in ewes include restlessness, approaching the pen in search of rams, frequent tail wagging and bleating, frequent urination, decreased appetite and milk production, vulvar swelling and mucus discharge, and occasional mounting with other ewes. These behaviors and signs are particularly pronounced when rams are near the pen. Normally, vaginal mucus in ewes is clear and egg-white in the early stages of estrus, gradually becoming turbid or even creamy in the middle and late stages. This can be used as a reference for determining estrus during artificial insemination.

The duration of estrus in ewes is approximately 24 to 48 hours, with an average of 36 hours. Stable ram-mounted estrus lasts an average of 24 hours. Studies have shown that estrus duration is significantly shortened after ram-mounted estrus or artificial insemination .

The ram's body odor and courtship behaviors, such as calling the ewe's vulva, the Flehmen reaction , tongue thrusting and rapidly flicking, chasing the ewe, and slapping the ewe's rump with his forelimbs, together constitute the "buck effect ," which can strongly induce estrus in ewes and enhance estrus symptoms. The sudden introduction of rams into the flock at the end of the anestrus season can not only advance the breeding season but also synchronize estrus. During the breeding season, the sudden introduction of rams after a month or more of isolation can also synchronize estrus in ewes within one to two weeks.

The estrous cycle length of female goats ranges from 17 to 25 days, with an average of 21 days, but may vary depending on region, breed, and flock. Ewes often experience short cycles, lasting 5 to 7 days. This is due to early regression of the corpus luteum after ovulation. These cycles typically occur during the transition period around the start or end of the breeding season, early puberty, the first estrus after parturition, artificially induced estrus during the anestrus season, or superovulation. Ewes may also have estrous cycles exceeding 25 days, often due to embryonic death occurring 15 days after mating, i.e., after maternal recognition of pregnancy .

Ovulation: Ovulation occurs in ewes at the end of estrus, approximately 24 hours after the onset of the LH surge in the blood. Most ovulation occurs in the right ovary (53.4%). Silent ovulation, without any signs of estrus, is common in ewes before the breeding season.

Most female goats give birth to twins, but triplets are quite common. The number of ovulations increases with age, reaching a peak between 3 and 6 years of age. The number of ovulations is closely related to factors such as breed, genetic selection, season, and nutritional status. Nubian goats ovulate more frequently than other dairy goat breeds; ovulation is higher early in the breeding season than late in the season; and ewes with a medium or higher body fatness have a higher ovulation rate. For ewes with a low nutritional level or body fatness, increasing the caloric content of their diet 6 to 8 weeks before the breeding season can promote estrus and increase ovulation, a process known as flushing.

Breeding and conception: Mature rams can mate up to 20 times per day. However, in naturally mated ewes, the appropriate ratio of rams to ewes is approximately 1:50. If estrus synchronization is used for ewes, the ratio is reduced to 1:20, and hand mating is recommended. This involves manually mating ewes in estrus one by one with rams to ensure effective mating.

Approximately 72 hours after ovulation, the fertilized egg or embryo of a goat divides to the 16-32 cell stage and enters the uterus through the oviduct. Hatching occurs on the 8th day, and during elongation on the 15th day, it secretes large amounts of trophoblast protein 1 (cTP-1), which blocks the secretion of the prostaglandin PGF2a in the maternal uterine mucosa, preventing atrophy of the corpus luteum. This process is crucial for the establishment of early pregnancy and is known as maternal recognition of pregnancy. From elongation to implantation, goat embryos undergo intrauterine migration, ensuring that each embryo secures sufficient space for implantation during multiple ovulations.

Gestation, Parturition, and Postpartum Recovery (gestation, parturition, and puerperium): The average gestation period for ewes is 150 days, with a variation of ±2 days between breeds. Gestation period varies among individuals depending on the sex of the fetuses, the number of fetuses, and the age of the ewe. Gestation periods are slightly longer in males, singleton fetuses, and older ewes. Pregnancy in goats depends on progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum throughout its duration. Injection of prostaglandins (PGF2a) or removal of the ovaries at any stage of pregnancy can cause miscarriage.

False pregnancy, or hydrometra, is a common phenomenon in goats. In this condition, the ewe's corpus luteum is functioning normally, and a large amount of fluid accumulates in the uterus, as if pregnant. However, ultrasound imaging reveals no fetus or placenta. Once the uterine fluid (cloudburst) is expelled, normal fertility can resume, but recurrence is not uncommon. False pregnancy often occurs in ewes bred in spring or after artificial estrus synchronization. The cause of this condition is unknown.

Most ewes give birth during the day, with labor starting within an hour. Twins are born in a shorter time than single lambs, but the time between births can vary widely, from a few minutes to over an hour.

It takes about 30 days for the uterus to recover after giving birth. The interval from giving birth to the return of estrus in ewes is affected by the ewe's fatness, nutritional level, milk production and season. The interval from giving birth to the return of estrus is significantly increased for high-yielding lactating sheep, ewes breastfeeding multiple babies and ewes with low fatness scores . Those who give birth in the spring anestrus season must postpone the return of estrus until the next breeding season.

Age of Puberty and Breeding: Although female sheep reach puberty and sexual maturity between 5 and 7 months of age, this does not mean they can be bred immediately. Breeding female sheep too early not only reduces the twinning rate and increases the rate of dystocia, but can also hinder their normal development, reduce milk production, and delay the return to estrus after birth, ultimately outweighing the benefits. Due to the varying nutritional needs of individual sheep, the ideal age for breeding female sheep varies. Generally, breeding is recommended when the female sheep's weight reaches at least 60% of that of a mature ewe. For example, if the average weight of a mature ewe is 50 kg, the female sheep should be bred at least 30 kg.

Male rams are puberty at around 5-6 months of age. Non-breeding rams must be castrated before 5 months of age, and breeding rams should be at least 18 months old before they can be used for breeding. The ratio of breeding rams to breeding ewes is approximately 1:50.

Body fatness adjustment: Breeding ewes must be properly fed and managed according to the physiological needs of growth, pregnancy, and lactation. Being too fat or too thin will affect normal reproduction. Body fatness or body condition score is used to represent the nutritional status of the sheep. The score can range from 1 to 5, with 1 representing the thinnest and 5 representing the fattest. The body fatness of the ewe at breeding will affect the number of ovulations, prolificacy, and reproductive efficiency. In addition to reducing the estrus rate, estrus visibility, and twinning rate, too thin ewes will also affect lactation and estrus recovery after delivery. Overweight ewes, especially ewes carrying triplets, are more likely to suffer from pregnancy toxemia in the late stages of pregnancy. Generally, the body fatness of multiparous ewes at breeding must be adjusted to around 2.5, and for female sheep, it must be adjusted to 3.0. For ewes with low leanness, increasing the daily concentrate intake or increasing the caloric content of the diet 6-8 weeks before the breeding season can effectively stimulate estrus and ovulation, thereby increasing the twinning rate. Leanness also affects the interval between estrus and return to estrus after parturition. Except for lactating ewes that are too thin or have multiple births, under normal nutritional conditions, meat ewes can return to estrus around 35 days after parturition (14-67 days). Before the breeding season, rams should be adjusted to a leanness of 3.0-3.5 to avoid excessive weight loss from continuous breeding during the breeding season. However, rams in the fallow season should avoid being overweight and a leanness of 2.5 is sufficient.

Estrus Detection: Utilizing test rams is the most effective method for detecting estrus in ewes. In sheep pens with a shared walkway behind the pens , stud rams can be placed in the walkway early and late in the morning. Ewes in estrus will actively approach the rams outside the pens and exhibit estrus signs, allowing managers to detect and record estrus status pen by pen. If a shared walkway is unavailable, vasectomized rams can be placed in the pens, or stud rams wearing bibs on their groins and abdomens can be used to assist in estrus detection. If suitable rams are unavailable , culled ewes injected with intramuscular testosterone or intersex sheep can be used as test rams, both of which are effective. Estrus detection should be conducted outside the feeding period of the ewes to improve detection efficiency.

Breeding Methods: Natural mating is the most common breeding method for meat sheep, and can be categorized as free mating or hand mating. Free mating involves placing rams into a flock of ewes for free mating. Its advantage is that it reduces the labor required for estrus observation and hand mating. However, its disadvantages are that it makes it difficult to accurately record the number of estrus ewes and the date of mating, and it can be difficult to accurately determine the ewes' precise pregnancy stage for grouping and segmented management. Furthermore, if too many ewes are in estrus in a single day, rams can often over-breed or develop a preference for specific ewes, resulting in wasted semen and reduced conception rates, thus impacting the reproductive efficiency of the flock. Rams can be bred up to eight times per day, but prolonged over-breeding is not recommended, as it can reduce conception rates and the useful life of the rams. It is best not to place two rams into the same flock at once to avoid competition, delaying mating, and confusing the pedigrees of the offspring. Another way of natural breeding is monitored breeding, that is, after the ewes are confirmed to be in estrus, they are manually monitored and accepted by the rams for breeding one by one, which can avoid many of the disadvantages of the aforementioned free breeding method.

To reduce the labor involved in estrus detection and breeding during the breeding season, consider installing a temporary ram pen within the ewe pen during the breeding season. Regardless of the natural breeding method, the male-to-ewe ratio should be maintained at approximately 1:50. However, if estrus synchronization is used, the male-to-ewe ratio should be increased to 1:20 or higher.

Improved feeding and management: Sheep require different nutritional levels and management methods depending on their physiological conditions, such as growth and development stage, leanness, pregnancy stage, and lactation status. Ewes in the middle growth and development stages, those in low leanness, in the last third of pregnancy and early lactation, and especially those nursing twins or more, require separate grouping and additional rations tailored to their physiological needs to achieve maximum reproductive efficiency.

A balanced diet is crucial for proper sheep reproduction. Besides insufficient energy and protein, which can affect normal reproduction, excessive protein, a deficiency in vitamins A and E, or a deficiency in minerals such as phosphorus, cobalt, manganese, zinc, and selenium can also reduce reproductive efficiency. Currently, all domestic mutton sheep are raised in confinement. Some farmers who rely on hay as their sole source of forage for extended periods must pay special attention to vitamin A supplementation, particularly intramuscular injections of vitamin A-3E one month before the breeding season, which can effectively improve reproductive efficiency.

Low calcium levels in the diet of late-pregnant dairy sheep, or excessive amounts of alfalfa, can cause postpartum hypocalcemia or milk fever . High phosphorus:calcium ratios in the diet of rams, with a phosphorus:calcium ratio close to 1 : 1 instead of the normal 1 : 1.5-2.0 , can cause urolithiasis . In addition to adjusting the calcium-phosphorus ratio in the diet, adding 6g of ammonium chloride daily to the ram's diet can help prevent urinary stones.

To reduce the risk of miscarriage due to stress, ewes should avoid deworming, vaccinations, hoof trimming, stalling, driving, and long-distance transport during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Breeding rams are generally housed individually. To maintain their breeding soundness , penned rams must have their hooves trimmed regularly and be provided with adequate space for movement.

Breeding ewes should have a complete breeding record and maintain a production of more than three parities in two years. If ultrasonic pregnancy diagnostic devices can be used to detect and treat false pregnancies in ewes early, or to eliminate ewes with habitual miscarriage and reproductive disorders early, it will help improve the reproductive efficiency of the flock.

Year-round breeding and seasonal breeding: Most meat-producing ewe flocks are bred using natural breeding. Depending on the length of the breeding period between rams and ewes, year-round breeding and seasonal breeding can be categorized as either year-round or seasonal. The advantage of year-round breeding is that once a ewe is in estrus, she is ready for breeding at any time. However, the disadvantage is that it is difficult to concentrate pregnancy and farrowing, making it difficult to manage separate groups for simultaneous feeding. Seasonal breeding involves designing two to three breeding seasons per year, with each season lasting approximately 45 days. This allows each ewe to have two or more breeding opportunities during the breeding season. This not only facilitates grouping and segmented feeding management of the ewes, as well as monitoring of the ewe's reproductive efficiency after the breeding season, but also facilitates the concentrated fattening and marketing of meat sheep due to the more concentrated birth dates of the lambs.

The auction market price of Taiwanese mutton exhibits significant seasonal variations, with prices beginning to climb after August and declining after the Lunar New Year. Furthermore, castrated rams are typically raised until 12 months of age before being put on the market for auction. Therefore, if the ewe flock can be mated during spring estrus and give birth in autumn, the castrated rams can be fattened and marketed the following autumn, increasing farmers' profits. Because most of Taiwan's existing mutton breeds are hybrids of Nubian and local goats, the lack of estrus in spring is less pronounced in ewes than in dairy sheep. The goat milk market and raw milk prices exhibit significant seasonal variations, and dairy sheep breeds naturally reproduce seasonally. Sheep farmers can set their breeding seasons based on individual needs. For information on how to induce estrus in ewes in spring, please refer to the section on artificial regulation techniques during the breeding season.

Artificial regulation during the breeding season: Autumn and winter are peak seasons for goat milk consumption, and raw milk prices are also higher. However, due to the estrus of ewes in the spring, most ewes are unable to give birth and reach peak lactation in the autumn. This not only reduces the reproductive efficiency of the flock, but also leads to an imbalance between supply and demand in the goat milk market and reduces dairy farmers' goat milk revenue. During the deep anestrus season, using the ram effect alone to induce estrus in ewes has limited effectiveness. However, the ram effect can be combined with other artificial induction methods to effectively enhance the induction effect. Among the methods of inducing estrus in ewes with anestrus in the spring, light regulation and hormone treatment are the more practical.

Light regulation: This method mimics the natural daylight patterns of summer and autumn to induce estrus. Light regulation can take up to four months. For example, if a flock of ewes is scheduled for breeding in May, they must begin receiving artificial light in January. This is accomplished by installing fluorescent lights 2.5 to 3 meters above the bedding in an open-plan barn. The light intensity at eye level is adjusted to between 200 and 250 lux. A timer is used to turn the lights on one hour before sunset, off for four hours at midnight, and off one hour after sunrise. During the day, the ewes receive only natural light, for a total of 20 hours of light per day. After two months of this, artificial lighting is turned off. After another two months, a test ram is introduced into the flock. Using the ram effect, most ewes can achieve estrus within two weeks. To maximize the ram effect, the ram should be kept as far away from the sun as possible during the lighting treatment. Light regulation is not only less expensive than hormonal treatment, but also conforms to natural laws. Once induced into estrus, ewes can maintain two to three estrous cycles, increasing the chance of conception without the side effects of hormonal treatment. To ensure that rams maintain their robust breeding capacity in the spring, they must also undergo light regulation. A three- year French experiment confirmed that alternating long-day (16L : 8D) and short-day (8L : 16D) exposures every two months significantly improved semen quality, regardless of seasonal variations.

Endocrine treatment: Endocrine treatment involves inserting a silicone gel (such as CIDR®, containing 366 mg progesterone) or foam (containing 45 mg FGA) into the ewe's vagina and leaving it in place for 11 days. However, on the ninth day, 48 hours before the vaginal plug is removed, each ewe receives an intramuscular injection of 500 units of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, formerly known as PMSG) and 100 micrograms of cloprostenol (a derivative of prostaglandin PGF2a, Estrumate®). The eCG injection dose can be reduced to 400 units for females and increased to 600 units for high-producing lactating sheep. Ewes enter estrus approximately 24 hours after the vaginal plug is removed. The advantages of this method include: (1) it is time-saving compared to light treatment; (2) it is effective: more than 90% of ewes can be induced to estrus, and the conception rate is more than 85%; (3) estrus is concentrated, which facilitates the implementation of artificial insemination; (4) it can increase the litter size, with an average of 2.2 piglets per litter. Disadvantages include: (1) CG antibodies may be produced, affecting the effect of subsequent eCG treatment; (2) treatment is only allowed once a year; (3) only one estrus breeding opportunity can be induced during the anestrus season; (4) the interval from the removal of the suppository to the onset of estrus in the ewe is proportional to the number of eCG treatments the ewe will receive in her lifetime, and the conception rate may also decrease with the increase in the number of treatments. Melatonin can also be used to induce estrus in ewes by subcutaneous implantation or oral administration, alone or in combination with light treatment, but the effect is not as significant as the above two methods, and commercially produced drugs are difficult to obtain, so it is rarely used.

Estrus synchronization technology: During the normal breeding season, rams are isolated from the flock of ewes for a period of time and then suddenly introduced back into the flock. This ram effect can induce estrus synchronization in the ewes. However, this type of estrus synchronization is not sufficiently concentrated to meet the requirements for artificial insemination. Commonly used estrus synchronization methods for ewes include prostaglandin (PGF2a) injection and the use of gestagens, PGF2a , and CG .

Prostaglandin (PGF2a) injection: PGF2a can cause corpus luteum atrophy, inducing estrus or abortion. Before administering PGF2a injections to ewes with unknown reproductive backgrounds, pregnancy should be confirmed. Ewes enter estrus approximately 48 hours after injection with PGF2a (e.g., Lutelyse®) or its derivative, cloprostenol (e.g., Estrumate®). Because developing corpus luteum cells are insensitive to PGF2a within five days of ovulation, and endogenous PGF2a is naturally secreted after day 16 of the estrous cycle, only one injection of PGF2a will result in only approximately two-thirds of the ewes in a flock of reproductively healthy ewes entering estrus. To synchronize estrus for the entire flock, a second injection of PGF2a must be given 11 days after the first.

gestagen, PGF2a, and eCG: Please refer to the "Artificial Regulation of the Breeding Season" section for this method. During the natural breeding season, the combined use of gestagen and PGF2a can significantly increase the frequency of estrus in ewes compared to using PGF2a alone. While CG can increase ovulation and farrowing rates, it also carries the risk of antibody production. During the normal breeding season, the use of eCG is not absolutely necessary.

Fresh semen collection and dilution: There are two methods of semen collection: electrical and artificial vaginal. The main principle of electrical semen collection is to use an electric rod to stimulate the seminal vesicle of the ram through the rectal wall to achieve the purpose of ejaculation. The quality and quantity of semen obtained by this forced semen collection method are inferior to those collected by artificial vaginal collection. It is generally only used for rams that cannot accept artificial vaginal semen collection training, are neurotic, have poor libido, or cannot use artificial vaginal semen due to limb disabilities.

The artificial vagina method is currently the most ideal method for semen collection in goats. The artificial vagina consists of three parts: a rubber-lined plastic tube that can be filled with 42 °C warm water, a silicone funnel, and a centrifuge tube for collecting semen. To minimize cold shock to sperm caused by temperature fluctuations outside the body , the equipment must be stored in a 39 ° C incubator during assembly and before semen collection. During semen collection, the artificial vagina kit must be protected by an insulating sheath to maintain the appropriate temperature. Before semen collection, the estrus ewe is secured to a neck rack. At the moment the ram's penis penetrates the vagina after mounting, the penis is inserted into the artificial vagina for ejaculation. After the artificial vagina is filled with warm water, air can be blown in through the water inlet to increase water pressure. Before semen collection, the inner wall is lubricated with a sperm-safe jelly.

Fresh semen, after being tested for appearance, volume, sperm concentration, motility, live sperm percentage, and total live sperm count, can be diluted at room temperature with skim milk (SKM) or egg yolk tris- fructose (YTF) diluent to an appropriate concentration for use. Because goat semen contains phosphatidase , which reacts with lactoglobulins and triglycerides, or metabolites produced by the breakdown of lethicin, potentially present in the skim milk diluent , reducing sperm viability and motility, centrifugal separation is recommended before dilution to remove the semen. The sperm concentration after dilution should be approximately 100 million live sperm per insemination dose (0.5 or 0.25 mL straw ) , or at least 5 x 10' . Any semen not used immediately after dilution should be placed in a water bath at a constant temperature and stored in a refrigerator at 6 °C. Freshly diluted semen should generally be used within one day.

Freezing and Thawing of Semen: After semen collection, it is diluted with Krebs-Ringer-Glucose saline to a concentration of 400 million sperm per mL. This is then centrifuged twice at 600g for 15 minutes, and the seminal plasma is removed. The washed sperm is diluted with skim milk diluent to a concentration of 1 billion sperm per mL and cooled to 4°C in a water bath. Finally, the diluted semen is diluted with skim milk diluent containing 14% glycerol at 4°C to a concentration of 7% glycerol and 500 million sperm per mL. After equilibration for 2 hours, the semen is divided into 0.25 mL straws, each containing 125 million sperm. Finally, the semen is frozen using liquid nitrogen vapor to rapidly cool the straws. The semen is then stored in a liquid nitrogen vat at -196°C for long-term storage. To thaw the frozen semen, remove the straws from the liquid nitrogen vat and plunge them directly into 36°C warm water for 30 seconds.

Artificial insemination equipment, timing, and techniques: Artificial insemination equipment includes a vaginal speculum with a light source, a semen thaw device, a straw sheath, an artificial insemination gun, and a lubricating jelly cream. For estrus synchronization using an intravaginal progestogen releaser (CIDR) using PGF2a and CG , estrus detection should be performed every three hours, starting 16 hours after CIDR removal . Artificial insemination can be performed 22 hours after estrus or 43 hours after CIDR removal . Frozen semen removed from a liquid nitrogen tank should be thawed in warm water at 36 °C for approximately 30 seconds. The straw should then be dried, the sealed end cut, and placed in the sheath. The straw should then be assembled with the insemination gun and used for later use. During insemination, the ewe must first be secured in a cervical cage. An assistant or other equipment should then be used to raise the ewe's hips to a near 90 -degree angle. Using a vaginal speculum and a light, the cervical opening is located. The insemination gun is then aimed at the cervical opening and slowly inserted. Once the gun has passed through the cervix, the semen is slowly injected into the uterus. The cervix is approximately 3.8 centimeters long and has three to five internal wrinkles. Only about 20% of estrus ewes have cervices that allow the insemination gun to pass smoothly. For most other ewes, do not force the gun; simply inject the semen into the cervix to a point within reach of the gun.

Superovulation and breeding of embryo donor ewes: Multiparous ewes with good leanness and normal reproductive background were selected as embryo donors. An intravaginal progestogen releaser (CIDR®) (AHI Plastic Molding Co., New Zealand) was inserted into the ewes' vagina (day 0) and left in place for 11 days. From day 9 to 11, i.e., 3 days before CIDR removal, a total of 20 A.U. (Armor unit) of pFSH (Tenka Pharmaceutical Co., Japan) was injected intramuscularly at 12-hour intervals in decreasing doses (4.8, 4.8; 3.4, 3.4; 1.8, 1.8). During the FSH treatment, 125 μg of prostaglandin cloprostenol (Estrumate®, Coopers, Germany) and 132 μg of LH (Sigma, USA) were administered. Another less expensive method for superovulation is to use eCG (Serum Gona, China Chemical Pharmaceutical, Taipei) instead of FSH. Each ewe requires a single intramuscular injection of 1000-1500 IU, along with a prostaglandin injection. For optimal ovulation, consider administering 1000 IU of hCG (Gona 500, China Chemical Pharmaceutical, Taipei) three days after the eCG injection. However, the number of viable embryos obtained using eCG is lower than with FSH.

Superovulated ewes will begin estrus on the day or the next following CIDR removal. Ewes in estrus should be immediately bred and mated naturally with the same ram every 12 hours, or artificially inseminated with frozen semen every 6 hours, until estrus ends. If the day of estrus is considered Day 0, embryo collection and transfer from donor ewes can be performed on Days 6-7, at which point the embryos have developed to the morula or blastocyst stage.

Synchronization of estrus in recipient ewes: Multiparous hybrid meat ewes were selected as recipient ewes. CIDR® was applied vaginally to the recipient ewes on the same day as the donor ewes and left in place for 11 days. However, on the 9th day, 48 hours before CIDR removal, each ewe was injected with 125 μg of cloprostenol and 500 IU of eCG to induce estrus synchronization with the donor ewes.

Embryo collection, recovery, and transfer: Embryos were collected from donor ewes by midline laparotomy on day 6 to 7 after estrus. The ewes were initially sedated with an intramuscular injection of 0.11 mg/kg xylazine (Rompun, Bayer, Germany). Ten minutes later, general anesthesia was achieved with an intravenous injection of 5.5 mg/kg ketamine (Shunshun, Yongxin Pharmaceutical, Taiwan). The surgical site in the midline of the abdomen in front of the udder was shaved and then disinfected with 70% alcohol and betadine. The uterus and ovaries were pulled out of the abdominal wall through a midline incision. After visual inspection of the number of ovulated eggs, the uterine horns were clamped near the uterine body with intestinal forceps to block the flow of irrigating fluid to the uterine body. Using a self-developed irrigating needle, the uterine horns were repeatedly irrigated twice using a one-way embryo flushing method, using 6-10 ml of PBS each time. The recovered irrigating fluid was briefly allowed to settle in a 15 ml centrifuge tube, and approximately 1-2 ml of the liquid at the bottom was aspirated with a pipette. Goat embryos were recovered under a stereomicroscope, and the embryo recovery rate (embryo recovery rate (%)) was calculated as (number of recovered embryos/total number of corpora lutea) × 100%. Recovered goat embryos were evaluated and screened for appearance quality according to the criteria of Lindner and Wright (1983).

Embryo transfer in goats: Embryos are transferred into the uterine horn on the same side as the corpus luteum through a midline laparotomy on day 6-7 after the recipient goat comes into estrus. Transferring two to three embryos per recipient goat increases the twinning rate. Pregnancy is diagnosed by ultrasound approximately 40 days after embryo transfer.

Diagnosis by external observation: During the breeding season, if a female goat does not return to estrus within 25 days after mating, it may be pregnant. Pregnancy can be diagnosed by observing mammary gland development in female goats around three months into their pregnancy. However, in multiparous ewes, especially lactating goats, pregnancy is difficult to diagnose based on changes in udder or abdominal size . Diagnosis based on abdominal palpation is inaccurate and unreliable.

Ultrasound pregnancy diagnosis: (1) Doppler ultrasound technology: Using the principle of the Doppler phenomenon, ultrasound can be used to detect uterine artery blood flow and fetal heartbeat sounds through the abdominal wall and rectum to diagnose pregnancy. (2) Real-time ultrasound technology: The detector has two forms: linear and sector (Figure 6-2-7), which are detected by the rectum and abdominal wall respectively. After receiving the ultrasound echo, it is converted into an image and displayed on the screen. The image of the fetus, amniotic fluid and uterine caruncle can be clearly distinguished. It can accurately diagnose as early as 30 days after pregnancy and the number of fetuses can be diagnosed within 45 days of pregnancy. In addition, it can also detect ewes with false pregnancies. It is currently the most accurate method for diagnosing pregnancy.

Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) progesterone concentration changes: About 21 days after mating, a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit can be used to measure progesterone concentrations in goat milk or blood to determine pregnancy. This method cannot distinguish between non-pregnant ewes with retained corpora lutea and those experiencing false pregnancies.

The Basic Concept of Humane Slaughter: In the information or knowledge economy, livestock production is viewed as part of the service industry, no longer solely focused on producing affordable, high-quality animal protein. It has evolved from simple production cost calculations to considerations of ecological conservation and, more recently, so-called ethical standards. Consequently, the consumption of livestock products is no longer solely driven by nutritional reasons; it is now viewed as a part of life's enjoyment. This focus on "production," "ecology," and "life" impacts the overall social image of the livestock industry and, of course, its sustainability. The livestock industry should cultivate an image of high quality, environmental compliance, and ethical practices based on the principles of caring for animals and respecting life. Animals may not possess human-like intelligence, but they do share our common emotions, including the ability to experience physical pain and psychological suffering. Caring for animals is not only about protecting their right to live, but also about preventing them from suffering unnecessary hardship. This concept is a shared understanding in developed societies and a crucial consideration in livestock production. Protecting animal welfare is a global ethical principle, an obligation and responsibility of society, and even a legal requirement. The suffering endured by animals during slaughter is a frequently criticized livestock welfare issue. The public is particularly concerned about unnecessary stress and suffering before slaughter. Transporting livestock and poultry before slaughter must be done with minimal stress, and stunning is mandatory before slaughter. This is a mandatory law, as practiced in developed European and American countries, and also included in Taiwan's Animal Welfare Act. A peaceful death is the fundamental principle of humane slaughter. Of course, death itself cannot be peaceful, but it can at least reduce suffering. Considering the welfare of livestock when they are brought to slaughter, and effectively stunning them before bleeding and slaughter, allowing them to die unconscious, are both legally mandated procedures. The transportation and slaughtering processes must be approached with compassion, kindness, and humanity. A "slaughter anyway" mentality is a serious concern.

Maintaining animal welfare and reducing pre-slaughter stress: With dedicated implementation, animal welfare measures can easily address some issues, and simple changes can yield significant results. For example, a holding area must be established within the slaughterhouse to allow sheep to recover from physical and mental fatigue after transportation, and clean drinking water must be available. Holding time should be at least two hours, and if it exceeds eight hours, feed should be provided. Fences should be used within the holding area to separate sheep from different groups. This prevents fighting between unfamiliar sheep, which can lead to stress and injury, and also facilitates veterinary inspection of the animals' health and helps identify the source of any problems. When moving sheep from the holding area for slaughter, it is advisable to pre-determine movement routes, ensuring that the animals move in one direction, in small groups, along a predetermined route. Using slow, steady, and quiet movements can avoid the use of brute force or electric prods, reduce stress, and improve efficiency. Furthermore, sheep are highly curious, and any noise, light, or equipment can distract them during the process. Using higher partitions to block external attraction is a simple but effective measure. Poor management and improper maintenance of equipment in slaughterhouses can easily reduce the effectiveness of use and increase animal suffering. Of course, there are also inappropriate planning and management, such as poor pen design and slippery walkways, which can also cause additional injuries and pain. Slaughterhouse design flaws and operations that violate animal behavior, such as dark walkways, strong winds, or people working noisily in front, can cause sheep to be frightened and difficult to drive, forcing staff to use more intense methods to drive them away, increasing the animals' suffering. In addition to following basic regulations when slaughtering sheep, operators should also use our wisdom and technology to develop methods to reduce stress.

The lack of awareness and education about animal welfare among industry professionals is often the crux of the problem. Some industry professionals, unaware of social trends and legal requirements, neglect animal welfare, even reacting with resentment, viewing these so-called humane appeals as merely hostile accusations, self-serving measures that are devoid of real value or meaning. The livestock industry must abandon this mindset, lest it be interpreted by the outside world as conservative, stubborn, and outdated, and thus illegal. While eating meat is natural, a civilized killing process should not involve additional cruelty. The livestock industry should encourage each other to uphold the principle of respecting life.

Effective stunning and reliable bleeding: Slaughtering livestock and poultry requires stunning before bleeding them out by piercing the heart or slitting the throat. This method causes the animal to lose consciousness and die from shock and blood loss, avoiding the conscious pain of death caused by direct bleeding. This is also a requirement of current animal protection regulations in Taiwan. The most common method used by the public to stun sheep is to hit the head with a handheld stick. This is not a method of stunning that is conducive to animal welfare because the location and force of the blow are difficult to control. Probes are often used abroad to cause stunning by damaging the brain. This is a cost-effective method, but it poses a threat of spreading sheep pruritus and is not promoted in Taiwan for safety reasons.

Stunning by electrical stimulation of the brain, also known as electric stunning, is an internationally recognized method for stunning sheep (goats and sheep). The required current/voltage conditions are 100-125 M/Amps, 1.0-1.25 Amps, 70-125 Volts, and a maximum duration of 10 seconds. The introduction site can be from the left and right cheeks in front of the ears or the nape of the neck behind the ears, depending on the direction of the restraint method. Electric stunning may have some adverse effects on meat quality due to improper operation, such as excessive loss of juice. Therefore, some slaughterhouses still use sharp knives to cut the throat to slaughter sheep, and slaughter them using traditional methods, with the meat quality appealing to the old-fashioned flavor. These myths certainly have their own market niches, but they are currently regarded as outdated practices that are contrary to animal welfare. In addition, it is not true that the meat quality of live slaughtered sheep is better. Scientific evidence and practice have proven that live slaughtered sheep have better carcasses. International experience has proven that electric shock is equally effective in slaughtering sheep. Improved electric stunning technology can now be tailored to suit the needs of traditional markets or processing operations, producing the appropriate meat quality. Taiwan has developed a smart electric stunning device for sheep that addresses the challenges of varying coat thickness and subcutaneous fat content, ensuring each sheep is reliably stunned and bleeding thoroughly with minimal strain. Lambs slaughtered this way retain their juiciness in a variety of dishes, whether stewed, roasted, pan-fried, stir-fried, or hot-dish, and has become popular with local businesses.

The key to successful electric stunning is effective restraint, a precise conductive point, and a stable stunner. When sheep are stressed, they not only push but also jump. Suspending their limbs (for example, with a net hammock supporting their abdomen), restraining their bodies with a clamp, and then pressing down on the neck behind the ears with a stunner before applying electricity can achieve satisfactory results. Of course, electric stunners must be routinely inspected to ensure their stable function. Abnormal current output, insecure animal restraint, incorrect shock site, and incomplete bleeding can not only stress the animal, causing it to consciously experience the pain of slaughter, but also affect the quality of the carcass.

Young lambs can be divided into the following three levels: hothouse lambs, which are about 2 months old and weigh 9-20kg; spring lambs, which are about 5-7 months old and weigh 20-25kg; and young lambs, which are 7-12 months old and weigh 25-30kg. Their carcasses are characterized by narrow ribs and a light red carcass.

One-year-old mutton carcass: The slaughter age is 10-12 months, the carcass characteristics are medium-wide ribs and the meat is slightly dark red.

Mature mutton carcasses: over 20 months old, divided into the following three grades according to sex: wether carcasses, ewe carcasses, and buck carcasses. Currently, wether rams available on the market in Taiwan are divided into three categories: pure black, parti-colored, and white.

Grading, cutting and utilization of domestic mutton carcasses: According to statistics from the Sheep Farming Association of the Republic of China, the number of domestic mutton slaughtered in 2004 was 17,258, and the trend is increasing year by year. This shows that domestic mutton still has room for development under the impact of imported mutton. The current standard specifications for grading, cutting and utilization of domestic mutton carcasses are described as follows: (1) Standard specifications for mutton carcasses: Taiwanese consumers prefer to eat mutton with skin, so Taiwanese mutton carcasses are based on unskinned mutton. The carcass specifications are as follows: 1. Complete bleeding. 2. Remove the toes between the carpal bones and metacarpal bones and between the tarsal bones and metatarsal bodies. 3. Remove the tail from the fifth caudal vertebra. 4. Remove the sexual organs and udder of the carcass. 5. Use flame to burn the surface of the carcass to make it slightly yellow. 6. Remove the horns. 7. Remove all internal organs. 8. Make a small amount of trimming of the carcass appearance, such as fat and minced meat. (2) Cutting and grading of mutton: 1. Whole-mutton cutting method: Cut the whole mutton into boneless skin-on mutton and boneless skinless mutton to supply the mutton stove. 2. Two-way cutting method: Cut the whole mutton into the front chest and abdomen and the hind leg, and then cut the front chest and abdomen into tenderloin (2%) , loin (4%) , flank (4%) , shoulder (4%) , and front leg (5%) ; and the hind leg into hind leg (7%) . 3. Three-way cutting method: Cut the whole mutton into shoulder, thoracic abdomen, and hind leg, and cut the shoulder into heart, middle rib, and front foot; cut the thoracic abdomen into flank, loin, and back, and then cut the flank into three layers of meat ( pork belly ) and belly ribs, and the back into large ribs, thick ribs, small ribs, and loin; and cut the hind leg into trotter, hind leg, and hind foot.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD): FMD is a highly contagious, acute disease caused by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a member of the genus Aphthovirus in the family Picornaviridae. The virus has seven serotypes: A, O, C, Asia I, South Africa I (SAT I), South Africa II (SAT II), and South Africa III (SAT III). Each serotype has multiple subtypes, and the seven serotypes do not cross-react or provide mutual protection. Transmission of FMD occurs through direct contact with blister fluid, saliva, semen, breast milk, exhaled air, feces, and urine from infected animals, which contain high levels of the virus. The virus can enter susceptible animals through the respiratory tract, oral cavity, and wounds. Feed trucks, animal transport vehicles, and carcass transporters can be contaminated and potentially spread FMD to other ranches. Tools, equipment, and cleaning supplies used at the site of an outbreak can spread foot-and-mouth disease. Workers' clothing, hats, and shoes can also serve as vectors. Unboiled viscera, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of infected animals can spread the disease. The virus can remain in the nasal cavity and throat of animal handlers, veterinarians, and public officials for 3 to 24 hours, potentially transmitting the disease to animals from humans. Infected animals excrete large quantities of virus through their respiratory tracts, especially pigs, which can excrete up to 400 million virus particles daily. These particles are carried by the wind, contributing to the rapid spread of the disease. Especially in low temperatures (below 10 degrees Celsius) and high humidity (above 60% relative humidity), transmission distances can reach tens or even 200 kilometers.

Taiwan has experienced an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (O/TAW/97) in pigs since March 1997, affecting only pigs and not cattle or sheep. In 1999, the foot-and-mouth disease virus (also known as FMD O Kinmen; O/TAW/99) was detected in Kinmen cattle. Although the virus was imported into Taiwan from Kinmen cattle and infected some beef cattle herds, there were no obvious clinical symptoms or losses in beef cattle at the time. Unfortunately, in late January 1990, foot-and-mouth disease broke out in dairy cows, with obvious clinical symptoms and lesions. In February 1991, another outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease occurred in sheep.

Clinical symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease: The incubation period is very short, approximately one to seven days. Affected animals clinically exhibit elevated body temperature, decreased milk production, decreased rumination, loss of appetite, and lameness. Small blisters form in the mouth and tongue. When these blisters rupture, shallow erosions may form, returning to normal after a few days. However, the sheep will only excrete the virus sporadically, acting as virus carriers. Newborn nursing lambs on infected farms will suddenly die. Autopsies of lambs aged 10 to 20 days will reveal tiger-striped heart lesions in the myocardium. Foot-and-mouth disease is generally only a subtle infection in sheep, especially with the O -type FMD virus, unlike cattle or pigs, which experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality after infection. The importance of FMD in sheep lies in the fact that when raised together with cattle, sheep often become a source of infection, acting as virus transmitters. The report indicates that after artificially infecting sheep, none showed clinical signs of disease. The virus could still be isolated from the throats of 87% of the sheep 28 days after inoculation. While the artificially inoculated sheep showed no visible clinical signs or signs of disease, the virus could still be isolated from their feces and throats 27 days after infection. Nursing lambs also develop tiger-striped heart disease because infected ewes excrete large amounts of virus in their milk. After suckling this milk, the virus invades the lamb's heart muscle, causing the disease.

Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease: Avoid purchasing sheep from infected areas. If purchases are unavoidable, strengthen quarantine measures. When foot-and-mouth disease occurs, strict lockdown, isolation, and disinfection measures must be implemented. Sheep pens should be disinfected regularly, and feces, leftover feed, and bedding from infected animals should be immediately destroyed. If vaccination is necessary, confirm the prevalent virus serotype in the area and select the correct vaccine for optimal results.

Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR): This disease is caused by Morbillivirus of the Paramyxoviridae family. The virus is slightly round and pleomorphic, larger than rinderpest virus, and contains a coiled, hollow, rod-shaped nucleocapsid composed of numerous herring-bone subunits. PPR is also known as Pseudorinderpest of Small Ruminants, Pest of Sheep and Goats, Kata, Stomatitis Pneumoenteritis Syndrome, and Pneumoenteritis Complex. It is an acute or subacute viral disease of goats and sheep characterized by fever, necrotizing stomatitis, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. Sheep are less susceptible than goats, and cattle are asymptomatic. This disease is also known as rinderpest in sheep.

Clinical symptoms of PPR: Acutely infected sheep experience a fever of 40-41°C. Affected animals exhibit lethargy, a coarse coat, dry nose, loss of appetite, and mucosal congestion. Initially, a serous nasal discharge may develop, later becoming mucopurulent and accompanied by a putrid odor. The incubation period is generally 4-5 days. Small areas of necrosis may occur in the nasal mucosa, and the conjunctivae are often congested, with small crusts forming in the inner corners of the eyes. Some animals experience severe catarrhal conjunctivitis with purulent eyelids. Necrotizing stomatitis is common. Initially, the oral mucosal lesions are rough and red, and may extend locally to the dental lamina, jaw, cheeks, mastoid processes, and tip of the tongue. Salivation is profuse but not excessive. Diarrhea is common, often profuse but usually bloodless. Coughing is a symptom of tracheopneumonia in the later stages of the disease. Pregnant females may experience miscarriage. Morbidity and mortality rates are high. Secondary bacterial infection exacerbates the disease and may complicate its symptoms. Gross visual lesions in affected animals include emaciation, conjunctivitis, and necrotizing stomatitis, often located on the lower lip, gums, cheeks, and sublingual area. Severe lesions may extend to the hard palate and throat. Erosive lesions are superficial, with no clear boundary between the red, rough areas and the surrounding normal area. The abomasum is a common site of lesion. Erosions in the anterior duodenum and terminal ileum may present as linear hemorrhages. Peyer's patches are significantly affected, and lymphoid tissue is necrotic. Lesions in the large intestine are primarily located at the ileocecal valve, the ceco-colonic junction, and the rectum. The rectum exhibits linear congestion due to mucosal folds, giving it a "zebra-striped" appearance.

Diagnosis of PPR: A preliminary diagnosis can be made based on clinical symptoms, pathological changes, and epidemiological data. Confirmation requires virus isolation and identification. Samples submitted for examination should include anticoagulated blood, lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen , and lungs. Because of the presence of common antigens, complement fixation or agar gel sedimentation tests cannot distinguish PPR from rinderpest. Neutralizing antibody testing can assist in the diagnosis of PPR.

Rift Valley Fever ( RVF) : This disease is caused by an RNA virus of the genus Phlebovirus , family Bunyaviridae . The virus is very stable in protein-rich solutions ( near-neutral pH ) . In serum, the virus can survive for two years in the refrigerator. It is stable and infectious in air, but acidic pH , lipid solvents, detergents, and common disinfectants do not activate the virus. All naturally isolated strains of the virus have similar biological and serological properties. RVF is an acute, arthropod-transmitted viral disease with high mortality in young animals. It primarily affects sheep, cattle, and goats, with clinical manifestations primarily consisting of hepatitis and abortion. Symptoms vary greatly and vary by species and age. Abortion occurs in most species, occurring during the acute or convalescent phase. Kids, calves, and sheep are most susceptible.

Clinical symptoms of Reeve Valley Fever: This disease can be categorized into four types: hyperacute, acute, subacute, and inapparent. The hyperacute form typically occurs in goats, calves, and sheep under seven days of age. It has an incubation period of 12 hours, followed by collapse and death within 24-48 hours. The initial illness presents with a fever (105-108°F). Although weakness, listlessness, and loss of appetite may occur in the 24 hours before death, the deceased animal exhibits no characteristic symptoms. The acute form typically occurs in older lambs and less frequently in adult sheep. It is characterized by a rapid rise in temperature (104-106°F), accompanied by vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and unsteady gait. Death occurs within one to four days of infection. The subacute form, which typically occurs in adult sheep, is characterized by a fever lasting 24-96 hours, accompanied by loss of appetite and general weakness. The mortality rate is low. The inapparent form presents only with a mild fever and is generally detectable by serological tests. Field and laboratory studies have shown that within a week of infecting sheep herds, Rif Valley fever can cause a 90-100% mortality rate in animals under seven days old, a 10-30% mortality rate in older and adult sheep, and a 95-100% abortion rate in pregnant ewes. Mortality is particularly high in young animals, and abortion rates are extremely high in cattle and sheep. Characteristic lesions are found in the liver.

Bluetongue : The virus that causes bluetongue is classified as an Orbivirus in the family Reoviridae . It is a double-stranded RNA virus, 80-100 nm in size, unenveloped, resistant to lipid solvents, and sensitive to acid. Naturally infected animals include sheep, cattle, goats, white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope, and bison. The incubation period in sheep is approximately 6-8 days, with symptoms including depression, fever, leukopenia, redness and swelling of the mucous membranes, lip and gingival ulcers, laminitis, coronitis, edema, torticollis, and vomiting. Ewes may miscarry or give birth to weak lambs. The incidence rate is 80-90% , but the mortality rate varies greatly, ranging from 0% to 50% . Infection in goats is generally asymptomatic . In Taiwan, the pathogen was isolated from asymptomatic sheep in Kinmen and Pingtung counties in June 2003 .

Clinical symptoms of bluetongue: Only sheep infected with this disease will have obvious pathological changes, such as bleeding at the base of the pulmonary artery, congestion and edema of the nasal mucosa and pharynx, pneumonia, bilateral bronchial lobular pneumonia, subcutaneous edema of the ear wings, congestion of the hoof crown, oral ulcers, heart bleeding, edema, skeletal muscle bleeding, necrosis, lymphadenopathy, lymph node congestion and bleeding, congenitally infected lambs, skeletal muscle infiltration of yellow gelatinous exudate, hydrocephalus, and cerebellar hypoplasia.

Sheep pox and goat pox: Caused by the Pox virus, sheep pox and goat pox are classified in the Capripox genus, which also includes the lumpy skin disease virus. These viruses are acid-labile and resistant to drying, and can survive in skin dander for over three months. While malignant pox diseases generally exhibit host preference, they are not host-specific for goats, sheep, or cattle.

Clinical symptoms of sheep pox include fever, rhinitis, lacrimation, and conjunctivitis. A rash is often found in areas of sparse fur , such as the axilla, groin, scrotum, udder, eyelids, lips, nostrils, and labia. Malignant sheep pox commonly occurs in goats and lambs, characterized by pox sores on hairless skin, respiratory mucosa, and oral cavity. This form has a mortality rate of 50-80% . Benign sheep pox, more commonly seen in adult animals, presents mild skin lesions and a low mortality rate of approximately 5-10% . Infected sheep develop pox sores, with varying degrees of congestion and edema surrounding the lesions. Tissue lesions resemble those of other poxvirus infections, characterized by acanthocyte hyperplasia and edema, with eosinophilic inclusions of varying sizes in the cytoplasm. This condition must be distinguished from contagious abscesses and foot-and-mouth disease. Diagnosis is primarily based on laboratory tests.

Caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE): Caprine arthritis encephalitis, also known as caprine arthritis encephalitis, is caused by the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAE), a member of the Lentivirinae subfamily of the Retroviridae family. It is very similar to the ovine Maedi-visna virus and causes similar symptoms in various natural hosts. Approximately 80% of sheep flocks in the United States, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand are contaminated, with fewer cases in Africa, possibly due to differences in milking methods. Antibody surveys have confirmed widespread infection in sheep in Taiwan. The primary route of infection is through the colostrum or milk of infected ewes. While transplacental transmission is possible, it is generally not considered the primary route. Horizontal transmission requires prolonged, close contact (more than several months).

Clinical symptoms of caprine arthritis encephalitis: Affected sheep develop arthritis, which progresses slowly over several months or even years. Arthritis primarily affects the joints, bursae, and tendon sheaths, most commonly in the knee joint. This type of disease typically occurs in adult sheep aged 2-9 years. If it occurs in lambs under 6 months of age, it often causes neurological symptoms, known as leukoencephalomyelitis (Infectious Caprine Encephalitis) or caprine Visna disease, with clinical manifestations of ataxia, lameness, and hind hind limb paralysis.

Diagnosis of caprine arthritis encephalitis: Diagnosis of this disease can be based on medical history, symptoms, gross visual examination, and histopathology. Infected sheep can be confirmed by serological methods (ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence staining, or immunodiffusion) or by isolating the virus from fetal synovial cells or primary goat testicular cells.

Prevention of caprine arthritis encephalitis: Immediately after birth, lambs should be separated from infected ewes and fed heat-treated (56 °C for one hour ) colostrum or colostrum from ewes not susceptible to the disease. Care should be taken to prevent lambs from coming into contact with any of the ewes' secretions. Lambs should be housed in well-ventilated isolation pens until weaning and fed goat milk, low-temperature sterilized cow's milk, or breast milk substitute that is free of the disease virus. Sheep that test positive for antibodies should be immediately culled. If two consecutive antibody tests show no positive results, the flock can be considered free of the disease. There is currently no vaccine available for this disease.

Contagious ovine ecthyme: Contagious ovine ecthyme, also known as contagious ecthyma, contagious pustular dermatitis, infectious dermatitis, or sore mouth, is a contagious ecthyma in sheep and goats caused by an Orf virus of the genus Parapoxvirus, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, family Poxviridae. It is distinct from sheep pox and goat pox. Contagious ovine ecthyme is a common disease in both humans and animals. Contact with infected sheep can also cause localized lesions. In 1993 , the Changhua Show Chwan Hospital discovered that goat farmers who frequently came into contact with infected sheep developed multiple pus-filled nodules on their fingers.

Clinical symptoms of goat contact abscess: This disease primarily occurs on the lips of young goats and sheep, initially presenting as papules, blisters, and pustules that eventually form scabs. Lesions are most common on the lips, oral mucosa, and face, with lesions rarely seen on other skin sites. Rarely, they occur on the limbs (between the toes and around the hoof), nipples, and genitals . While the disease has a high incidence, its mortality rate is low. Newborn lambs and ewes often refuse to eat or nurse due to pain in the affected area, leading to emaciated lambs due to starvation. Secondary bacterial infection can affect growth or even lead to death. If there are no other secondary infections, recovery occurs in about a month.

Prevention of goat contagious abscess: This disease is transmitted through direct contact between sheep or through ingestion of contaminated feed or water. Infected sheep must be fully isolated, and shed scabs, contaminants, and housing must be disinfected. Antibiotics can also be administered to prevent bacterial secondary infection. Some countries use live virus vaccines to prevent this disease.

Mycoplasma arthritis of goats: Mycoplasma arthritis in goats, caused by infection with Mycoplasma spp., can cause high morbidity (100%) and mortality (10-30%) in goats. The disease is most common in late spring and summer. It occurs in all countries where goats are raised. Mycoplasma can infect goats of all ages, sexes, and breeds, but primarily affects young and yearling dairy goats. Affected goats often experience mastitis, agalactia, pneumonia, keratoconjunctivitis, and arthritis. Severe cases can lead to abortion, with minimal or no respiratory effects. In addition to arthritis, some goats may also experience corneal opacity and increased ocular and nasal discharge. Transmission occurs through direct contact with infected animals or contact with their secretions, such as milk, urine, tears, and nasal discharge. Transmission of the bacteria into the udder during lactation is a key mode of infection.

Clinical symptoms of mycoplasma arthritis in goats: Infected animals often develop septicemia, with clinical symptoms including fever (40°~42.5℃), lethargy, weakness, and coarse coat. Arthritis is usually multiple, with the wrist, tarsal, and knee joints most commonly affected. The joints will swell, become hot, and painful. Clinical symptoms last for about 4 to 10 days. If left untreated, the animal will generally die, though spontaneous recovery may occur occasionally. Pathological changes of this disease include joint swelling, and upon dissection, the accumulation of large amounts of synovial fluid and yellow-white pus in the joint cavity can be seen, as well as pulmonary edema, fibrinous pleurisy, and fibrinous pericarditis. Some cases may also present with serous or fibrinous peritonitis, meningitis, and mastitis.

Prevention of goat mycoplasma arthritis: This disease can be treated with antibiotics, mainly tetracyclines, tylosin erythromycin, oleandomycin, spiramycin, and Tiamulin. However, tiamulin has a severe irritating effect on the injection site when injected intramuscularly, so caution is required. The main transmission route of this disease is contact transmission, so the affected sheep must be isolated . At the same time, if a ewe develops mastitis, it is necessary to determine whether it is infected with mycoplasma. The affected ewe must not feed the lambs, and the newly born lambs must be fed with sterilized goat milk or artificial milk substitutes. Therefore, the control methods of this disease include (1) strictly removing the infected sheep, and the removal work should be carried out once a year or every six months to ensure the health of the flock. (2) Regular deworming. Goat ear mites play the role of a medium in the spread of mycoplasma, and can be dewormed with anthelmintics such as invermectin.

Caseous lymphadenitis: Caseous lymphadenitis, also known as pseudotuberculosis, is a chronic infectious disease that mimics tuberculosis. It is caused by the Gram-positive bacillus Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (Corynebacterium ovis), primarily infecting adult sheep and goats.

Clinical symptoms of caseous lymphadenitis include swelling of multiple lymph nodes throughout the body, with large amounts of thick, cheesy pus visible within these swollen nodes. In most dairy goats (75-87%), abscesses develop in the head and neck lymph nodes near the ears, jaw, and above the anterior scapula. Clinically, two spherical lumps are common in the neck. In severe cases, the swollen lymph nodes may rupture, discharging large amounts of yellowish-white pus. A cheesy, milky-white substance can be seen on cross-sections of swollen lymph nodes. In goats with systemic infection, abscesses of varying sizes may be seen in the lung parenchyma, spreading across the diaphragmatic or cardiac lobes, with accumulation of yellowish, milky material within the parenchyma. Clinically, this can lead to chronic coughing and dyspnea.

Prevention of caseous lymphadenitis: Surgical removal and drainage of mature superficial abscesses can be performed. Alternatively, antibiotics can be used. However, most antibiotics cannot penetrate the lymph nodes and kill the bacteria. Penicillin or tetracycline is generally used for naturally ruptured abscesses to prevent the bacteria from spreading or invading other lymph nodes.

Paratuberculosis (Johne's disease): Paratuberculosis, also known as Johne's disease, chronic bacterial enteritis, or chronic proliferative enteritis, is caused by infection with the acid-fast bacterium Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (M. johnei), resulting in chronic wasting diarrhea in ruminants.

Clinical symptoms of paratuberculosis: This disease typically occurs in adult sheep. Goats infected with this bacterium do not develop the persistent watery diarrhea seen in cattle. Affected sheep appear thin, lethargic, and depressed, with intermittent, intractable diarrhea and progressive weight loss. This disease is economically important. In dairy sheep, silent infection can lead to decreased milk production, significant losses such as prolonged interconception intervals, mastitis, and reproductive failure. Affected sheep display cachexia, such as hypoproteinemia and subcutaneous edema of the jaw. Gross lesions include localized or diffuse edema or thickening of the intestinal wall in the ileum, cecum, and colon, and enlarged inter-enteric lymph nodes.

Prevention of paratuberculosis: The treatment effect of this disease is limited, so prevention is more important than treatment to eliminate the source of infection, eliminate carriers and strengthen feeding management as the only way.

Tuberculosis : Tuberculosis is a chronic, wasting zoonosis that primarily occurs in densely confined, poorly managed pastures. The causative organism is Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. bovis) and Mycobacterium avium (M. avium) , members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex . Mycobacteria are Gram-positive bacteria, and acid-fast staining is a common method for identification. The pathogen can infect sheep through the respiratory tract, digestive tract, skin wounds, semen, and the placenta.

Clinical symptoms of tuberculosis: Sheep infected with tuberculosis usually do not show symptoms. Some infected sheep may show emaciation, anemia, cough, nasal discharge, or severe respiratory symptoms. Macroscopic lesions are mainly in the lung tissue and lymph nodes. The cross-section surface may show yellow-white cheesy material. Some nodules may show sand-like calcifications on the cross-section surface. In severe cases, the disease may spread through the blood and form caseous lesions in other organs or lymph nodes.

intradermal tuberculin test ( ITT ) is the primary method for tuberculosis prevention . 0.1ml of M. bovis purified protein derivatives ( PPD) is injected into the inner side of one of the folds at the base of the sheep's tail. 72 hours after injection, any swelling at the injection site is considered positive. Animals with a suspected positive tuberculin reaction should be retested between 14 and 60 days later. Animals still suspected of being positive or positive are also considered infected. Sheep farms must cooperate with local county or city livestock disease control centers to conduct regular tuberculosis testing, remove infected sheep, and maintain dry, well-ventilated, and properly disinfected sheep pens.

Bacterial pneumonia ( Pasteurella pneumonia): Pasteurella pneumonia is an acute and fatal disease caused by the Gram-negative bacillus Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella haemolytica, which can cause severe pneumonia and even death in goats.

Clinical symptoms of bacterial pneumonia: Acute cases can cause a fever of 40.0 to 41.1°C, with purulent, viscous nasal fluid, difficulty breathing, and a wet cough. The mortality rate in goats can exceed 10%, with sudden death typically occurring after the onset of symptoms. Lesions primarily occur on the anterior ventral side of the lungs (apex, cardiac, and anterior ventral sides of the diaphragmatic lobes), appearing as dark red to grayish-white, firm lesions. These lesions are sometimes accompanied by fibrinous pleuropneumonia.

Prevention of bacterial pneumonia: The prevention and treatment of this disease include the use of antibiotics, improving ventilation in the shed, improving sheep nutrition and reducing stress.

Listeriosis: Listeriosis, also known as circling disease, is caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes and is a sporadic disease common to humans and livestock. It can be isolated from the feces or circling contents of healthy cattle, pigs, dogs, and rats. This bacterium is highly resistant to external influences and can survive in food for several months, making it a significant foodborne pathogen.

Clinical symptoms of listeriosis include encephalitis, stillbirth, and mastitis. Symptoms of encephalitis include vestibular tremors, circling, head tilt, and falling to the ground with swimming-like movements of the limbs. Transmission is typically through ingestion of contaminated silage (pH exceeding 5.5). Gross lesions may reveal meningeal congestion or edema, increased cerebrospinal fluid, and focal necrosis in the brainstem.

Scrapie: First discovered in British sheep in 1730, it was quite prevalent in Central Europe. Affected sheep experience itching and may rub against walls, tree trunks, and fences. Symptoms include unsteady gait, tremors, blindness, falls, and ultimately death. The pathogen is a mutated protein called a prion. In 1982, Dr. Prusiner SB of the United States published in Science that the causative agent of scrapie is a particle consisting solely of protein and no nucleic acid. He named it the proteinaceous infection particle, or prion. Prions, abbreviated as PrPC , are found on the surface of many cells in both normal animals and humans . The normal structure of PrPC is four α- helices . However, for unknown reasons, two of the β- helices are misfolded into a β -plate-like structure. This misfolded prion is called PrPSc , with Sc standing for scrapie , and is both infectious and pathogenic. Because PrPS cannot be hydrolyzed by normal proteases, it accumulates in brain tissue, causing nerve cells to die and eventually develop spongiform cavities in the brain. Humans or animals can be infected with PrPSc through two main pathways: oral infection through contaminated food, where PrPSc is ingested and proliferates in the tonsils. The immune system, primarily B cells, carry PrPSc to peripheral lymph nodes and the spleen. Follicular dendritic cells then facilitate PrPSc replication, where B cells carry PrPSc to peripheral nerves, ultimately infecting brain nerve cells. Another route of infection is iatrogenic infection, where PrPSc is acquired through medical procedures such as hormone injections, blood transfusions, and surgical procedures. This pathogenic prion can infect peripheral nerves and ultimately brain nerve cells through the blood or lymph, causing spongiform encephalopathy.

Prevention of scrapie: This pathogen is quite resistant to traditional standard disinfection methods. Under the most adverse conditions, highly effective disinfectants are high-concentration sodium hypochlorite or NaOH solutions. When preparing tissue sections, formalin-fixed tissues should be treated with 98% formic acid for at least one hour to inactivate isomerized prion.

Diarrhea in young sheep: Diarrhea is often caused by viral (rotavirus infection), bacterial (colibacillosis, Salmonella, enterotoxemia), parasitic pathogens (nematode enteritis, cryptosporidiosis, piroplasmosis, coccidiosis), toxic substances such as mycotoxins, and nutritional (feed-induced pullorum). The onset of disease in young sheep can be divided into three age groups: birth to four weeks, four weeks to twelve weeks, and over twelve weeks, each with different etiologies. Climate and environmental factors often exacerbate the condition, making it difficult to treat and should not be ignored.

Treatment of diarrhea in young lambs: The key to treating diarrhea in lambs is maintaining a balanced physiological function. This includes first moving the lamb to a warm, dry place to maintain body temperature. Appropriate fluid therapy, including lactated Ringer's solution, sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), glucose, and glycine, should be administered to prevent dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia, and acidosis. Treatment is oral or intravenous, depending on the severity of the diarrhea. In acute diarrhea, extreme caution should be exercised when feeding breast milk or milk substitutes to avoid digestive disturbances. Lactose in breast milk is difficult to digest, creating high osmotic pressure in the digestive tract and worsening diarrhea. Lambs with persistent diarrhea should be fed small amounts of milk to prevent starvation. Alternatively, an appropriate electrolyte solution can be mixed with a small amount of milk. If the diarrhea improves, milk can be slowly reintroduced, followed by frequent small amounts to prevent overloading the intestinal digestive system. On the other hand, appropriate administration of antibiotics, in addition to killing pathogens, can also prevent the occurrence of secondary bacterial pneumonia.

Prevention of diarrhea in young lambs: Isolate affected lambs or temporarily move healthy lambs away from the affected area. For viral diarrhea or Cryptosporidium infection, isolation is an important emergency preventive measure, as there is no specific treatment. Newborn lambs must receive colostrum within 6 hours of birth, and start feeding slowly at 2 weeks of age to activate the rumen and establish the appropriate rumen flora.

Indigestion in young sheep: It includes simple and toxic indigestion, and the main features are digestive dysfunction and varying degrees of diarrhea. (1) Improper feeding of pregnant ewes is the main cause of indigestion in young sheep. Especially in the late pregnancy, it directly affects the development of the fetus and seriously affects the quality of breast milk. Poor quality and small amount of breast milk not only cannot meet the development needs of young sheep, but also makes the already underdeveloped young sheep hungry, thus causing disease. (2) Improper feeding and management of ewes. Common animal house hygiene conditions are too poor, or they are cold and damp. Unclean nipples or feeding devices of lactating ewes, long-term lack of straw changes, resulting in feces accumulation, etc., are all predisposing factors for this disease. (3) Improper feeding of young sheep, such as feeding colostrum too late, artificial feeding at irregular times and quantities, which makes the young sheep in an uneven state of fullness and hunger and licks debris. If these factors are not improved, it will also cause comprehensive symptoms such as indigestion in young sheep.

Clinical symptoms of indigestion in young sheep typically occur during the lactation period, often shortly after birth, when colostrum is ingested . Symptoms gradually subside after two to three months of age. If the affected sheep are listless, have a decreased appetite, and have a normal or slightly low body temperature, and have loose, watery, pale yellow, grayish-white, or dark green feces with a sour or fishy odor, and contain curds or undigested feed, this may indicate simple indigestion. Toxic indigestion, on the other hand, can manifest as severe digestive disorders and malnutrition, with symptoms such as depression, sluggish eyesight, loss of appetite, general weakness, fever, and severe diarrhea. Feces contain large amounts of mucus and blood, with a foul and putrid odor. Persistent diarrhea can lead to anal relaxation, fecal incontinence, and sunken eyes due to dehydration. In the later stages of the disease, the affected animal suffers from hypothermia, cold extremities, cold ears, and nose, and eventually falls into a coma and dies.

Treatment of indigestion in young sheep: (1) Adjust gastrointestinal function, usually taking pepsin or yeast orally three times a day. If the diarrhea is watery and has a foul odor, astringents such as activated charcoal or lysozyme can be used to stop diarrhea. (2) Antibiotics or sulfonamides are given to inhibit bacteria and reduce inflammation. (3) For severe diarrhea, intravenous therapy is used to adjust metabolic acidosis and supplement nutrition. (4) After eliminating the cause of the disease, attention should be paid to the hygiene of the sheep house, keeping it dry, and the artificial feeding device should be disinfected.

Prevention of indigestion in lambs: (1) Improve the management of ewes and strengthen the care of lambs. Feed ewes with complete feeds and sufficient vitamins and trace elements. (2) Improve sanitary conditions during pregnancy, provide outdoor exercise, and allow lambs to eat colostrum as soon as possible. If breast milk is insufficient, artificial feeding can be used. Feeding utensils should be kept clean and disinfected regularly. The owner should develop the habit of freezing and storing colostrum, the more the better, in case of emergency. (3) Prevent lambs from catching cold and provide them with plenty of drinking water.

Malnutrition in young lambs refers to a systemic nutritional and metabolic disorder that results in poor development in young lambs, often caused by nutritional deficiencies in pregnant ewes. Because young lambs have weak immune systems, they often develop other illnesses, exacerbating their condition and leading to death. Malnutrition in pregnant ewes, especially in the late stages of multiple pregnancies, can lead to nutritional deficiencies in the dam and fetus, especially when the feed is deficient in protein, vitamins, inorganic salts such as calcium and phosphorus, and trace elements. This can cause nutritional deficiencies in both the dam and the fetus, severely impacting fetal development. Furthermore, reproductive malformation in ewes, poor semen quality in rams, and inbreeding can all contribute to malnutrition in young lambs.

Clinical symptoms of malnutrition in lambs: lambs are light in weight, lack subcutaneous fat, are too weak to walk, have a low body temperature, and most die within 10 days of birth.

Prevention and treatment of malnutrition in young lambs: Feed adequate colostrum or an appropriate amount of milk replacer. If the lamb cannot breastfeed, switch to artificial feeding. Again, it's important to freeze and store colostrum. Also, ensure heat preservation and use straw bedding to keep it dry and clean. Providing lactating ewes with a full diet can strengthen their physique and promote the secretion of good milk, which is a source of nutrition for the lambs.

Rickets : Rickets is a chronic disease of young animals characterized by incomplete bone calcification caused by vitamin D deficiency and impaired calcium-phosphorus metabolism during growth and development. It commonly occurs in piglets, lambs, and calves. It is primarily caused by vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency and an inappropriate calcium-phosphorus ratio. Vitamin D can only be utilized by the liver and kidneys through oxygenation, where it plays a role in bone calcium extraction and intestinal calcium absorption. Vitamin D deficiency can occur in breast milk or feed , particularly during winter housing periods when feeding coarse hay . Alternatively, chronic digestive disorders in lambs can prevent adequate absorption of the vitamins in breast milk or feed. Insufficient sunlight and physical inactivity reduce the ability of the skin to convert provitamin D to vitamin D , potentially impairing calcium absorption and bone mineralization. Calcium-phosphorus deficiency or insufficiency in the diet results in a calcium phosphate deficiency, preventing osteoblasts from completing calcification. An inappropriate calcium-phosphorus ratio (normally 1:1-2:1) impairs calcium absorption and calcification. In addition, insufficient breast milk, early weaning, high protein or fat content in the diet, excessive strontium and fluoride in feed or drinking water, or parathyroid dysfunction are all causes of this disease.

Clinical symptoms of rickets: Early symptoms include pica, digestive disorders, a tendency to lie prone, lameness, and slow growth and development. Swollen bones in the joints of the limbs, bowed or X-legged when standing, and beaded swelling of the ribs and costal cartilage. Other symptoms include spinal curvature and skull enlargement.

Prevention and treatment of rickets: Get plenty of sun exposure. Medical treatment often involves cod liver oil or vitamin D. Lambs should be given 5-10 ml of cod liver oil orally daily (but discontinue use if diarrhea develops). Additionally, intramuscular injections of 75,000-150,000 IU of vitamin A and vitamin D should be administered for 10-20 days. In severe cases, the dosage can be increased, and calcium supplements such as oral calcium carbonate or calcium lactate or intravenous calcium gluconate should be administered.

Neonatal Hypoglycemia: Normal blood sugar levels in lambs are generally 2.8-3.9 mmol/L (50-70 mg/100 ml). Hypoglycemia is characterized by a significant decrease in blood sugar levels, leading to brain and nerve dysfunction. This is primarily caused by incomplete feed intake during pregnancy, postpartum milk deficiency, or the inability of the lamb to suckle. After birth, lambs experience increased activity and increased sugar consumption. If there is a lack of sugar during the fetal period or if adequate sugar is not provided after birth, blood sugar levels can plummet to below 1.7 mmol/L (30 mg/100 ml), severely impacting brain function and causing excitation or inhibition of brain nerves.

Clinical symptoms of neonatal hypoglycemia: Symptoms occur in lambs under one week old, and are more common in lambs 14 days old. They include sudden loss of appetite, depression, slowed reflexes, weak limbs, and an unsteady gait, followed by collapse. Neurological symptoms include muscle tremors, spasms, opisthotonos, paddling, dilated pupils, and loss of light sensitivity, ultimately leading to coma, hypothermia, and death within 2-5 hours of onset. However, prompt recovery is possible with timely feeding or glucose injections.

Prevention and treatment of hypoglycemia in newborns and young animals: When symptoms occur and the condition is suspected, administer 20-40ml of 5-10% glucose and amino acids intravenously as soon as possible, repeated every 3-4 hours for 2-3 days. Additionally, administer 20-30ml of 20-50% glucose orally twice daily for several days, along with vitamin B complex and vitamin C.

Pneumonia in young sheep: The respiratory mucosa of young animals has greater vascular permeability, the lymph nodes around the pharynx are not fully developed, the bronchial glands secrete less mucus, and the ciliated epithelium has poor motility, resulting in weaker foreign body clearance and barrier defenses. Therefore, improper husbandry, sudden changes in weather, and cold weather can weaken the physiological defenses of young animals, allowing pathogens that invade the respiratory tract to proliferate and secrete toxins, damaging tissues and causing symptoms.

Clinical symptoms of pneumonia in young sheep: The disease typically occurs in lambs aged 1-3 months. Symptoms include a fever between 39.5-41 °C, a rapid and weak pulse, rapid and labored breathing, coughing, and a serous, mucous, or mucopurulent nasal discharge. Diarrhea may also occur. Common causes include pasteurization , chlamydia pneumonia , and mycoplasmapneumonia .

Prevention and Treatment of Pneumonia in Young Sheep: Affected sheep should be housed in a clean, well-ventilated barn. Enrofloxacin or antibiotics such as Ceftiofur or Florfenicol should be administered intravenously with saline solution twice daily to replenish dehydration. In addition, general symptomatic treatments, cough suppressants, expectorants, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, and cardiotonic agents should be used.

Intestinal spasms in lambs: Intestinal spasms are intermittent abdominal pain caused by spasmodic contractions of intestinal smooth muscle due to factors such as cold weather. They often occur in lactating lambs, especially when they begin to graze, drink water, and ruminate. The incidence is high, and if left untreated, they can lead to intussusception, intestinal ectopy, and death. While the primary cause is cold weather stimulation, intestinal spasms can also be caused by improper husbandry and management, such as lambs ingesting rancid milk or moldy, indigestible feed, malnutrition in ewes, low-quality milk, and frequent starvation in lambs.

Clinical symptoms of intestinal spasms in lambs include cold ears and nose, hypothermia, pale mucous membranes, standing with an arched back, and lying in a curled-up position. During abdominal pain, the lamb may look back at the abdomen, kick with its hind legs, and sometimes assume a urinary posture. In severe cases, the lamb may suddenly jump and cry continuously before returning to a quiet state.

Prevention and treatment of lamb intestinal spasms: Lambs affected by the disease can be treated with intramuscular or intravenous injections of the analgesic Buscopan (0.2 mg/kg) three times daily, or the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic Flunixin (1.1-2.2 mg/kg). For larger lambs, a warmed mixture of isotonic glucose and 0.5% procaine solution can be injected intraperitoneally. Applying a warm compress to the affected abdomen and administering warm milk simultaneously can achieve rapid results. Ensure lambs are kept warm, avoid starvation, and monitor their diet.

Osteodystrophia fibrosa in goats : The most common skeletal disease in goats is Osteodystrophia fibrosa in goats. Osteodystrophia fibrosa is a nutritional bone metabolic disease also known as Osteitis fibrosa cystica . Osteodystrophia fibrosa is often caused by a diet high in phosphorus and low in calcium, leading to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. This leads to nutritionally induced hyperparathyroidism, which causes excessive bone resorption and the pathological changes in bone tissue associated with Osteodystrophia fibrosa. Inexperienced goat farmers, unaware of their goats' nutritional needs, often feed them only soy dregs for convenience. This leads to an imbalance in the calcium-phosphorus ratio in the blood, triggering secondary hyperparathyroidism, which in turn causes calcium reabsorption from the bones, leading to the massive lysis of bone cells and their replacement by fibrous connective tissue, resulting in osteoporosis.

Clinical symptoms of fibrous osteodystrophy in goats: The most common sites of the disease are the upper and lower jaws. Affected animals often experience breathing difficulties due to swelling of the facial bones compressing the nasal passages. Swelling of the upper and lower jaws also makes it difficult for these animals to bite, leading to excessive salivation. Excessive mineral loss reduces bone structure, replacing it with fibrous connective tissue, resulting in a very soft bone. Goats have the highest incidence of the disease among ruminants, believed to be related to their difficulty regulating blood calcium and organic phosphorus levels.

Pregnancy toxemia (ketosis): Pregnancy toxemia, also known as ketonemia, is a metabolic disease in pregnant ewes, often occurring in lactating sheep before delivery. It causes black, tarry diarrhea, anal fouling, depression, anorexia, sunken eyes, inability to stand, and ultimately death. This condition occurs when the rapid growth of triplets in late pregnancy squeezes the abdominal cavity, leading to insufficient food intake and hypoglycemia. This causes the ewes to break down their own body fat and tissue to supply blood sugar, resulting in elevated acetone levels, ketonemia, ketonuria, proteinuria, and neurological symptoms. Autopsies of deceased triplets reveal enlarged, yellowish livers.

Prevention and Treatment of Pregnancy Toxemia: Affected ewes can be treated with intravenous glucose for several days. Affected ewes may develop acidemia, which can be prevented by administering sodium bicarbonate. During pregnancy, special attention should be paid to nutritional support, such as increased energy and protein intake during the last two months of pregnancy.

Goiter: There are five causes of goiter: (1) iodine deficiency; (2) ingestion of grasses that cause goiter; (3) ingestion of substances containing thiocyanate, such as crucifers; (4) ingestion of goitrin, such as iodized thiooxalyl sulfide and cabbage seeds; (5) blocking hormone formation; damaging the metabolic pathways of the thyroid gland, etc.

The causes of iodine-deficiency goiter are as follows: (1) iodine deficiency in soil; (2) iodine deficiency in drinking water or feed; (3) It is more common in Boer and Angra goats. If the feed of a pen-raised ewe is iodine-deficient (no salt added to the feed), the iodine stored in the body will be consumed during lactation and pregnancy. If the mother becomes pregnant again, the iodine necessary for the development and growth of the fetus will not be supplied, causing compensatory hyperplasia of the fetus's thyroid gland and enlargement.

Clinical symptoms of goiter: In severe cases of iodine deficiency, the fetus fails to develop, resulting in death and miscarriage. Aborted fetuses are underdeveloped and hairless. Iodine-deficient goiter in lambs born to grazing ewes is often a regional disease caused by iodine-deficient soil or high levels of calcium, iron, and other minerals in drinking water.

Prevention and treatment of goiter: (1) Iodine deficiency: Supplement iodine; provide iodized salt in the feed of pregnant ewes. (2) Congenital: During pregnancy, ewes should avoid grasses of the genus Clerodendrum or supplement with iodine. Lactating sheep should be provided with 0.8 ppm iodine; if there are cruciferous plants in the grazing area, increase the iodine supply to 2 ppm; the general iodine supply for sheep is 1.3 ppm.

Urinary stones in rams: Most urinary stones in sheep form in the bladder as silicates. Urinary stones are carried by urine into the bladder and can be carried to the narrow S-bend of the urethra or the urethral process at the end of the urethra, causing blockage. Improper calcium-phosphorus ratios in feed, insufficient vitamin A supplementation, and frequent contamination of drinking fountains, resulting in insufficient water for sheep, can all contribute to urinary stone blockage in rams.

Prevention and treatment of urethral stones in rams: Use lidocaine to anesthetize and relax the urethral mucosa, attempting to expel the stone. After urethrotomy, rams are no longer suitable for breeding. To prevent and treat stones, attention should be paid to the calcium-phosphorus ratio (Ca:P = 2-2.5:1) and vitamin A supply to prevent bladder epithelial sloughing. Furthermore, drinking troughs should be cleaned regularly to ensure that the sheep have access to clean water at all times, preventing urine from being stored in the bladder for long periods of time, which will naturally reduce the risk of stone formation. Adding 4% salt to the feed can increase water intake and urine output. Since phosphate and carbonate stones are more likely to form in alkaline urine, ammonium chloride can be added to increase urine acidity to prevent stone formation.

Acute bloat: A symptom of rapid and excessive gas production in the rumen and recombinant stomach. Causes include: overeating easily fermentable foods or foods low in fiber ; paralysis of the rumen and recombinant stomach muscles ; excessive foaming in the stomach, which hinders the excretion of belching gas ; esophageal obstruction or paralysis ; lymphadenopathy or tumor compression of the esophagus caused by lymphocytic leukemia ; rumen motility disorders; insufficient exercise or general weakness in the sheep ; drinking too quickly after feeding or grazing; and strenuous exercise after feeding.

Clinical symptoms of acute bloat include rapid abdominal distension, particularly on the left side, and rumen cessation. Rumination ceases, with frequent belching and occasional vomiting. Defecation occurs initially but ceases in later stages. Respiration is rapid, with the forelimbs extended and motionless. Rumen compression causes blood flow obstruction, palpitations, a rapid pulse, bluish-purple mucous membranes, cold ears and extremities, sweating, and suffocation. Severe cases can lead to death within a few hours, but some patients recover spontaneously after half a day or a day.

Prevention and treatment of acute bloat: (1) Raise the forelimbs, massage the flanks, and drive the sheep uphill to contract the stomach and release gas. (2) Pull the tongue up and down to help with belching. Alternatively, use a nasogastric tube to remove accumulated gas. (3) Stomach puncture. (4) Parasympathetic stimulants. (5) Intragastric instillation of anti-foaming agents, such as peanut oil. (6) After the acute symptoms subside, pay attention to feeding and management to prevent recurrence. Reduce the amount of food, do not give grass, and give bitter stomachic or laxatives. Feed hay before grazing.

The importance of sheep house planning: A good breeding environment can improve the growth and reproduction performance of sheep, and provide convenient working space for managers. More importantly, it can enable the sheep farming business to operate perfectly while taking into account the ecological balance. The so-called good breeding environment here refers to the sheep house and its surrounding related facilities.

The first challenge encountered when establishing a sheep farm is sheep shed design. The complexity of sheep shed design is closely related to the capital required to establish the farm, as well as the subsequent husbandry, management, disease control, and waste management. In other words, sheep shed design is closely linked to the success or failure of the farm. For example, poorly designed sheep sheds can lead to inefficient farm management, difficulty controlling diseases, and increased difficulty in wastewater treatment, all of which can reduce profits or even lead to losses for sheep farmers. Therefore, sheep shed design plays a crucial role in the future success or failure of a sheep farm. While sheep shed design is important, it must be complemented by good husbandry and management. However, it is difficult to find a perfect sheep shed, so coordination among all aspects is crucial for sheep shed users.

The key to sheep housing planning is profitability for sheep farmers. However, regardless of the amount of profit, one should not consider investing all capital or profits in building or renovating sheep housing. Doing so often leads to capital constraints, especially when sheep prices are low after a large investment, often rendering the farm unsustainable. Therefore, before renovating a sheep housing facility, one should carefully consider whether existing sheep housing problems can be overcome through improved husbandry and management practices. If this is possible and economically justifiable, it is best not to renovate the sheep housing facility.

Flexibility in sheep house planning: Even if we do not consider the cost at all, there is no perfect sheep house so far, because under different requirements or to achieve different purposes, sheep houses need to be designed with expedients. The factors that affect this are as follows: (1) Different objects of consideration: Some facilities are quite convenient for sheep farmers, but they are not necessarily beneficial to sheep, and vice versa. (2) The level of wages: The level of wages will affect the planning of sheep houses. For example: When wages are low, the equipment in the sheep house does not necessarily have to be automated, because automation will consume a lot of investment costs; but when wages are high, automated equipment in the sheep house will help reduce production costs. (3) The amount of funds: When funds are not very abundant, if most of the funds are invested in the sheep house, it will be detrimental to the normal operation of the sheep farm. (4) Different purposes of sheep house establishment: For example, the use of mesh beds in small sheep houses is safer than strip beds. (5) Environmental differences: In coastal areas, it is best to avoid using iron materials to build sheep sheds. This is because the air in coastal areas is high in salt, and this high salt content will accelerate the rusting of iron. (6) Differences in feeding sections: Some sheep farms raise ewes and lambs together, while other sheep farms raise ewes and lambs in separate groups. Therefore, there are naturally differences in the design of sheep sheds.

Basic principles of sheep house planning: Although sheep house planning has its own flexibility, its basic principles remain unchanged. They include: (1) Considering future development in advance: If there are plans to expand the scale of the sheep farm, future development should be carefully considered when building the sheep house. For example, if the sheep house is small, a plan should be made for how all the sheep houses will be arranged after future expansion. Another example is that if the sheep house is small, it is likely that the same sheep house will have both farrowing pens and mature sheep pens. For future development, consideration should be given at the beginning of the farm construction to how to easily convert the former to the latter, or the latter to the former. This is because after the sheep farm expands, for the convenience of management, the same sheep house is generally used to house the same period of sheep, so the original sheep house must be uniformly modified. (2) An environment suitable for the growth and reproduction of sheep: Only an appropriate environment for the growth and reproduction of sheep can achieve the best results for the sheep and make profits for the sheep farmer. (3) Convenient Operation and Labor Savings: A sheep house is not only a breeding environment for sheep, but also a place for managers to operate. Therefore, when designing a sheep house, considerations should be given to labor saving and reducing the risk of accidents. Saving labor not only reduces breeding costs, but more importantly, only when the house is conveniently operated can staff have more time to focus on sheep health and other management tasks. (4) Compatible with breeding and management methods: Breeding and management methods are changing rapidly, and many of them require appropriate sheep houses. Therefore, if a sheep farmer wishes to adopt a specific breeding and management method, the sheep house required for this method should be included in the design when designing the sheep house. (5) Good Sanitation Planning: When designing a sheep house, consideration must be given to maintaining a hygienic environment within the farm, including planning disinfection routes for personnel and sheep entering and exiting, and arranging the movement of sheep in and out of the house. For example, whether an "all-in, all-out" approach should be adopted to meet hygiene requirements. (6) Avoiding Facilities that Harm the Physical and Mental Safety of Sheep: The future trend in sheep farming is to provide a safe and welfare environment for sheep, and this trend also brings benefits to sheep farmers. (7) Convenient waste management: With the increasing number of sheep raised by sheep farmers, waste management has become a key issue in sheep barn planning. Only good management can prevent environmental pollution, the spread of disease, pollution of the surrounding environment, and low work morale. Proper waste management measures can also bring benefits, such as the reuse of feces and urine. (8) The most economical construction cost: This does not refer to the cheapest construction cost, but rather the most favorable construction cost after comprehensively considering factors such as the sheep environment, labor costs, waste management, and climate, such as typhoons.

Site selection: This includes two scenarios: selecting new land where there is no existing land, and arranging the entire sheep farm's location on existing land. The following summarizes the considerations for both scenarios: (1) Area: When selecting a site, consider the total area required for the sheep farm, the size of the pasture, future expansion plans, waste disposal facilities, and workshops. (2) Water Source and Water Quality: A sufficient water source and good water quality are essential for a successful sheep farm. In addition to drinking water, sheep farms also need water for flushing and other purposes. Water quality not only refers to the amount of minerals contained in the water, but also whether the water contains toxic organic substances, such as pesticides and herbicides, and whether the water source contains high bacterial counts. This is especially important if there are many pastures upstream of the river, as too many pastures can easily transmit diseases from other pastures to the farm. (3) Drainage and Wastewater Treatment: The treated wastewater from the sheep farm must have an outlet. The treated wastewater should be discharged into streams without contaminating the water source. When establishing a larger ranch on a hillside, drainage from the entire sheep shed can utilize the existing slope. Wastewater and rainwater should be drained separately, so these factors should also be considered when selecting a site. (IV) Sheep Sheep Orientation: 1. Sheep sheds should be oriented east-west, facing north-south. Sheep sheds with an east-west orientation and facing north-south are preferred. Avoid slopes facing east or west. This is because sheds on such slopes are exposed to the sun for one morning or afternoon each day, which can cause heat stress and prevent good performance. 2. Sheep sheds should be located on slopes that are sheltered from the wind. Choose slopes or land with little north wind or sheltered from the north wind. Generally, south-facing slopes are preferred, as wind speeds increase cold stress in cold weather. 3. Avoid humid areas. Unless you live in an area with heavy winter rain, avoid building sheep sheds in areas with heavy winter rain, as the damp and cold weather is not conducive to sheep production. 4. Avoid using steel building materials in coastal areas. When choosing a coastal area, it is important to avoid using building materials that are easily corroded by salt, such as steel. (V) Others: 1. Convenient transportation: Convenient for the transportation of feed and sheep, as well as for the movement of personnel. 2. Close to a power source. 3. Avoid being too close to other sheep farms. Sheep insulation and water supply systems require electricity.

Basic information for estimating sheep farm facilities: The sheep house is composed of sheep of different growth ages or physiological stages. In order to divide these sheep into different livestock houses, the following basic information of the sheep must be available, and the amount of livestock houses for each stage can be calculated based on this information. However, when planning livestock houses in general, the data used should be relatively loose so as to avoid the phenomenon of insufficient livestock house space when it is used.

The following basic information on livestock housing also lists the allowances used in sheep housing design. 1. Conception rate for ewes: Approximately 90.5% ; for females: 61.2% . To prevent excessively successful breeding performance and the resulting lack of space for sheep, allowances of 95% and 70% are used for the housing calculations . 2. Lamb-carrying period for ewes: 35-70 days , calculated as 45 days. 3. Ratio of rams to ewes: This varies from ranch to ranch, ranging from 1 : 5 to 1:45 . The recommended ratio is between 1:20 and 1:25 . 4. Average litter size: This ranges from 1.27 to 2.28 , with a recommended range of 1.5 to 1.8 . 5. Lamb survival rate: Lamb mortality is approximately 0 % to 28.6% , with an average of 6.56% . Using a loose value of 7-10% , the survival rate is calculated as 93-90% . 6. Ewe Survival Rate: The mortality rate for ewes is generally 0-4.3% , with an average mortality rate of approximately 1.31% . Therefore, the recommended survival rate is 95-98% . 7. Age at estrus: The average age for females is 7-10 months, and for rams is 4-8 months. However, light breeding is recommended between 8-10 months, with intensive breeding between 8-10 months. The estrus cycle for sheep is approximately 18-22 days ( generally estimated to be 21 days ) , with an estrus period of 12-36 hours.

The space required for sheep is divided into two categories: ( 1 ) Body size at different ages: The body size of sheep varies across breeds and ages. However, for the purpose of calculating barn space, the size of the largest Boer goat currently available can be used as a reference . Figure 9-4-2 shows the weight of Boer goats at different ages. According to a survey of Khari sheep, a body size of 40-50 kg results in a height and length range of 57-80 cm and 58-80 cm, respectively. ( 2 ) Space required per sheep: The Danish recommended space requirement for each ewe is 10.67 m² , with a maximum of 2.1 m² . For ewes with lambs, this area is 0.91 m² , with a maximum of 6.5 m² (Andersen , 2002) . The generally recommended housing space is as follows: 1. Rams: 1.9-3.1 m² solid floor per ram , 1.3-1.9 m² striped floor per ram; 2. Dry ewes: 1.1-1.5 m² solid floor per ram, 0.7-0.9 m² striped floor per ram; 3. Ewes with lambs: 1.4-1.9 m² solid floor per ram, 0.9-1.1 m² striped floor per ram; 4. Meat sheep: 0.7-0.9 m² solid floor per ram, 0.4-0.5 m² striped floor per ram. The farrowing pen should be 1.8 x 1.2 m² (Wathes and Charles, 1994).

The feeding trough and hay rack space required for each sheep: Denmark recommends a feeding trough space of 37 cm for each sheep. The generally recommended feeding trough space is as follows: 1. Rams: limited to 30 (cm/head), free to feed 15 (cm/head); 2. Dry ewes: limited to 40-50 (cm/head), free to feed 10-15 (cm/head); 3. Ewes with lambs: limited to 40-50 (cm/head), free to feed 15-20 (cm/head); 4. Meat sheep: limited to 23-30 (cm/head), free to feed 2.5-5 (cm/head).

The drinking space required for each sheep is as follows: The generally recommended drinking space is as follows: rams (180-300 pounds): 10 drinking bowls (number of sheep/drinking bowl), 10 nipple drinkers (number of sheep/nipple drinkers), 2 drinking troughs (number of sheep/30 cm); dry ewes (150-200 pounds): 40-50 drinking bowls (number of sheep/drinking bowl), 40-50 nipple drinkers (number of sheep/nipple drinkers), 15-25 drinking troughs (number of sheep/30 cm); Ewes with lambs (5-30 lbs): 40-50 drinking bowls (number of lambs/drinking bowl), 40-50 nipple drinkers (number of lambs/nipple drinkers), 15-25 drinking troughs (number of lambs/30 cm); Meat sheep (30-110 lbs): 50-75 drinking bowls (number of lambs/drinking bowl), 50-75 nipple drinkers (number of lambs/nipple drinkers), 25-40 drinking troughs (number of lambs/30 cm).

Required sheep sheds: 1. If the ratio of male and female sheep is 1:20 , 200 + 20 = 10 sheep, and the male sheep should rest for three days after every three days of mating. 2. Farrowing shed: (1) If the lambs are weaned at 45 days old and the ewes are in estrus year-round, eight batches of lambs can be raised per year, 200 + 8 = 25 lambs, and the ewes need about 25 × 110% = 28 pens. (2) If the lambs are weaned at 30 days old and the ewes are in estrus from July to February, eight batches of lambs can be raised per year , 200 ÷ 8 = 25 lambs , and the ewes need about 25 × 110% = 28 pens. 3. Meat sheep: If each litter is twins, 25 × 2 = 50 lambs / pen. If the farrowing shed (1) is used, a maximum of six batches of lambs, or 300 lambs, are needed before the first batch of meat sheep is sold . If the farrowing shed (2) is used , 50 × 8 = 400 lambs need to be raised .

Required feed storage: 200 ewes + 20 rams + 400 meat sheep = 620 sheep. If the average sheep consumes 0.7 kg of concentrate, then the weekly concentrate requirement is 620 kg x 0.7 kg x 7 days = 434 kg x 7 days = 3,038 kg. If the average sheep consumes 3-3.5% of their body weight minus 0.7 kg of concentrate, then a 60 kg sheep x 3.5% - 0.7 kg = 2.1 kg - 0.7 kg = 1.4 kg. 200 sheep x 1.4 kg x 7 days (purchased hay) = 1,960 kg/week, or 200 sheep x 1.4 kg x 90 days (silage or hay storage for three months) = 25,200 kg. Therefore, a sheep farm would require approximately five 600 kg concentrate storage silos and enough hay storage space to store 1,960 kg or 25,200 kg, depending on the design of the hay storage space.

Grazing Area Required: The grazing area required is based on the number of sheep. The approximate daily hay requirement per sheep, grass production (the soil and season are factors), and the available land area are used to calculate the number of sheep that can be raised, the required land area, or the number of days a fixed number of sheep can be grazed. Actual conditions may be more complex than the above, for example, if supplemental concentrate or roughage is required in addition to grazing, or if grazing is supplemented with purchased forage.

For example, a sheep farmer with one hectare of land planted with pangu grass can produce 80-150 metric tons of fresh grass or 15-28 metric tons of hay annually. Each adult sheep requires approximately 5-8 kg of grass per day and 2-2.5 kg of hay in winter (approximately 11-13 kg of grass). If the season lasts for four months and the season lasts for eight months, then the annual feed requirements for each sheep are: Hot season: 245 days x 5 or 8 = 1225 kg or 1960 kg. Cool season: 120 days x 11 or 13 = 1320 kg or 1560 kg. Or, 1225 kg + 1320 kg = 2545 kg. Total: 1960 kg + 1560 kg = 3520 kg. This means that raising one sheep requires approximately 2545 kg or 3520 kg of grass per year, or 2.5 tons or 3.5 tons of hay. A hectare producing 80-150 metric tons of grass per year is sufficient for sheep farming. 80 or 120 metric tons ÷ 2.5 = 32 or 48 heads; 80 or 120 metric tons ÷ 3.5 = 22 or 34 heads, that is, the pangu grass produced on poor land can support 22-32 sheep, and the pangu grass produced on good land can support 34-48 sheep.

Striped floor: Coart (1983) pointed out based on experiments that the strip width of 6 cm and the spacing between the strips of 1.5 cm are the best striped floor design for pig houses. Except for plastic mesh floors which are not suitable for sheep houses, the metal mesh used in pig houses can be used in sheep houses.

A cross-section of a large sheep shed design, featuring manual manure scraping. The netting on both sides of the shed primarily prevents sheep feces from entering the ditch, though urine can enter. Automatic manure scraping equipment is also planned for the future.

A general diagram of the farrowing house. The key point is that the farrowing house does not use striped floors, but mainly uses metal mesh floors to prevent the lambs' feet from sinking into the striped floors and getting injured.

A partial plan view of the farrowing pen emphasizes that the door opening should be oriented in the direction sheep enter and exit the pen. Ideally, the door and aisle should be of equal width, so that once the door is opened, the sheep are forced to enter and exit through this door. The diagram also clearly indicates the presence of three aisles, allowing the shepherd to feed the ewes from the center aisle and feed and manage the lambs from the side aisles. Separate feeding troughs prevent ewes from stealing the lambs' feed. The water troughs are positioned so that both ewes and lambs have access to water, eliminating the need for separate lamb drinking fountains.

70cm height of the outer aisle pen , making it easy for staff to operate. The trough and farrowing pen are separated by galvanized iron pipes ( which can be movable ) , primarily to prevent ewes from entering the lambing area.

The key to the design of the feeding trough is that the height should be kept to a minimum, approximately 45 cm. Diamond-shaped mesh is used underneath to prevent the sheep from slipping out, while ample space (approximately 36 cm) is provided above the trough for the sheep's heads to reach out and feed. The trough's height of 18 cm and width of 30 cm represent the maximum commercially available large water pipe dimensions. Using this large pipe as a water trough is also a good option. While a 110 cm high pen can be prone to jumping out for some sheep, the design of the pen's top allows for a 25 cm clearance to prevent such an escape.

The key elements of a hay rack's cross-section design are the height from the ground and the height of the rack itself. These values can vary depending on the specific sheep. The second key element is the spacing between the bars of the hay rack. Currently, a typical spacing of 15 cm is used. This allows for easier access to the grass and minimizes wasted grass.
