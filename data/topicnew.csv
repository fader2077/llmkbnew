1,What emergency measures can farmers take to improve survival when a newborn lamb cannot stand or suckle on its own?,Breeds,"When a newborn lamb is too weak to stand or suckle, immediate human assistance is required. Farmers should help the lamb stand and guide its mouth to the ewe¡¦s teat to stimulate the suckling reflex. If suckling remains difficult, colostrum can be fed using a bottle, along with vitamin solutions, sugar water, or energy supplements to increase energy levels. Thiamine injection may also enhance vitality. If the lamb still cannot feed, a veterinarian should be consulted to perform stomach tube feeding with colostrum to ensure adequate early nutrition."
2,"What are the three major causes of mortality in newborn lambs, and how should hypothermia be managed in emergency situations?",Breeds,"The three major life-threatening problems for newborn lambs are inability to feed independently, insufficient milk supply from the ewe, and hypothermia. Hypothermia commonly occurs in cold or damp environments, especially in premature or weak lambs. Emergency treatment includes drying the lamb immediately and placing it close to the human body to reduce heat loss. In severe cases, the lamb can be immersed in warm water with the head kept above the surface to rapidly raise body temperature, followed by thorough drying and continued warming. Heat lamps are commonly used to maintain body temperature in less severe cases."
3,"Why are young goats more susceptible to clinical disease caused by Moniezia spp. infection than adult goats, and what are the common clinical signs?",Breeds,"Adult goats infected with Moniezia spp. usually show mild or no clinical signs, whereas young goats are more susceptible due to immature intestinal development and higher nutritional requirements. The movement of the tapeworm within the small intestine irritates the intestinal mucosa, and parasite metabolic by-products further impair digestion and nutrient absorption. Common clinical signs include reduced appetite, digestive disorders, anemia, growth retardation, weight loss, abdominal distension, and edema. Severe infections may result in death. Goats younger than eight months are therefore considered a high-risk group."
4,"What is the life cycle of tapeworm infection in goats, and what farm management practices can reduce the risk of infection?",Feeding & Management,"Common tapeworms infecting goats, such as Moniezia expansa and Moniezia benedeni, use oribatid mites as intermediate hosts. Goats become infected when they ingest mites containing infective larvae during grazing. Oribatid mites are commonly found in moist pasture and surface soil, making environmental conditions a major risk factor. Farm management strategies include avoiding grazing after rainfall or during early mornings when dew is present, implementing routine deworming programs (approximately 2¡V4 times per year), and promptly treating heavily infected goats followed by a second treatment two weeks later to reduce egg shedding and reinfection."
5,"Why does abortion caused by Chlamydophila abortus in goats usually occur during mid to late pregnancy, and what is the main pathological mechanism?",Feeding & Management,"After initial infection, goats infected with Chlamydophila abortus usually show only mild and transient clinical signs, followed by a latent infection stage in which the pathogen persists in the uterine mucosa. During mid to late pregnancy (around day 115 of gestation), the bacteria become reactivated and replicate rapidly, causing severe necrotizing placentitis. This results in necrosis of placental cotyledons, impaired nutrient and oxygen transfer to the fetus, and ultimately fetal death, abortion, or stillbirth. Some does may show blood-tinged vaginal discharge 2¡V3 days before abortion, and retained placenta may also occur."
6,"What are the main transmission routes of Chlamydophila abortus in goat herds, and what zoonotic risks should farm workers be aware of when handling abortion cases?",Feeding & Management,"Chlamydophila abortus is mainly transmitted through oral or nasal contact with contaminated aborted fetuses, placentas, fetal fluids, newborn kids, or uterine discharges, and may also spread via aerosolized particles. After abortion, infected does can continue shedding the bacteria through the reproductive tract for several weeks. Even if subsequent pregnancies appear normal, these animals may remain a source of environmental contamination. Because C. abortus is a significant zoonotic pathogen, farm workers handling abortion materials without proper protection may develop flu-like symptoms. The risk is particularly serious for pregnant women, as infection may cause placentitis and lead to abortion or stillbirth. Therefore, abortion cases should be managed by isolating affected does, using appropriate personal protective equipment, thorough disinfection, and ensuring that pregnant personnel do not handle aborted materials."
7,"What are the advantages and disadvantages of confinement feeding versus grazing for goats in Taiwan, and how should farmers choose between them?",Diseases,"In Taiwan, both confinement feeding and grazing systems have their advantages. Confinement allows better control of nutrition, health, and reproduction, making it suitable for medium to large farms or operations requiring precise management, although feed and facility costs are higher. Grazing can reduce feed costs and allow natural foraging behavior but requires sufficient land and increases exposure to parasites and weather-related risks. The choice should be based on farm size, land availability, labor capacity, and management goals."
8,What are the key considerations for goat housing design under Taiwan¡¦s hot and humid climate?,Diseases,"Under Taiwan¡¦s hot and humid conditions, ventilation, cooling, and moisture control are critical in goat housing design. Good natural airflow or mechanical ventilation helps reduce heat stress. High roofs, open-sided structures, and adequate shade improve heat dissipation. Dry flooring and proper drainage are essential to prevent hoof problems and parasite buildup. Well-designed housing directly affects feed intake, reproductive performance, and overall health."
9,"What problems can arise from excessive stocking density in goats, and how should grouping be managed?",Diseases,"Excessive stocking density can lead to increased competition for feed, higher stress levels, faster disease transmission, and reduced reproductive performance. Grouping goats by sex, age, and physiological status (such as pregnancy or lactation) helps reduce competition and improves management efficiency. Appropriate stocking density and grouping support herd stability, reduce injuries, and enhance productivity."
10,What early warning signs should caretakers look for during daily goat herd inspections?,Nutrition,"During daily inspections, caretakers should observe feeding behavior, alertness, mobility, and fecal consistency. Reduced appetite, isolation from the group, lameness, abnormal breathing, or changes in feces often indicate early health or management issues. Early detection allows timely intervention, reducing disease spread and production losses."
11,"Why is management closely linked to reproductive performance in goats, and which management factors have the greatest impact?",Nutrition,"Management directly affects body condition, stress levels, and health status in goats, which in turn influence estrus expression, conception rates, and kidding outcomes. Key management factors impacting reproduction include adequate nutrition, heat stress control, appropriate stocking density, and effective disease and parasite control. Sound management forms the foundation for consistent reproductive performance. Using a 50-goat farm as an example, the key to group management is to separate goats according to sex, physiological status, and growth stage, rather than keeping all animals together. For instance, bucks should be housed in a separate group to avoid disturbing does outside the breeding period. Does can be further divided into late-pregnant and open or early-pregnant groups, allowing feeding and management to be adjusted according to their needs. Weaned growing goats should be kept in a separate group to prevent competition with adult goats for feed. Recently kidded does and their kids should be managed separately for a short period to ensure successful nursing. This type of grouping reduces competition and stress, allows goats with different requirements to receive appropriate nutrition, facilitates early detection of abnormalities, and improves overall herd management and reproductive stability."
12,"Why should forage selection for goats consider not only nutrient composition, but also feeding behavior and forage quality?",Nutrition,"Goats are classified as ¡§browse-type¡¨ animals and generally prefer leaves and legume forages over grasses. Studies show that goats exhibit large differences in intake depending on forage quality, particularly digestibility. Even when nutrient compositions appear similar, forages with lower organic matter digestibility or higher NDF and ADF contents significantly reduce voluntary intake. Therefore, ignoring feeding behavior and forage preference and relying solely on nutrient values may result in reduced intake, insufficient nutrient consumption, and ultimately poorer health and production performance."
13,How should feeding and nutritional management be adjusted for goats during late pregnancy or under heat stress conditions?,Others,"During late pregnancy, especially in twin-bearing does, energy and protein requirements increase by approximately 30% and 44%, respectively. However, fetal growth reduces rumen capacity, limiting feed intake. As a result, nutritional needs cannot be met by increased intake alone. Practical strategies include increasing dietary nutrient density by raising concentrate proportions or using forages with higher protein content and digestibility to supply more digestible nutrients per unit of intake. Under heat stress conditions, high temperatures significantly reduce dry matter and NDF intake while increasing body temperature and respiration rate. In addition to cooling strategies such as misting and ventilation, dietary adjustments are necessary. These include reducing forage proportion or replacing high-NDF forages with lower-NDF alternatives to decrease rumen heat production, thereby improving intake and productive performance such as milk yield or weight gain."
14,"What are the common native goat breeds raised in Taiwan, and what are their main reproductive and utilization characteristics?",Others,"The most common native goat breed raised in Taiwan is the Taiwan Black Goat, which includes several regional populations. Native goats are well adapted to Taiwan¡¦s hot and humid climate, show good disease resistance, and can efficiently utilize roughage. Their reproductive activity is relatively seasonal, with higher estrus expression during autumn and winter. Although they have smaller body size and slower growth rates, their meat quality is highly valued for local production and genetic conservation."
15,"What are the major imported or improved goat breeds raised in Taiwan, and what reproductive management considerations are important for these breeds?",Others,"Common imported or improved goat breeds in Taiwan include Boer goats and their crossbreds, which are mainly used for meat production improvement. These breeds have larger body size, faster growth, and higher meat yield, but they are more sensitive to heat and humidity. Their reproductive performance can be negatively affected by heat stress. Proper nutritional management, body condition control, and heat mitigation strategies are essential to maintain good estrus expression and conception rates."
16,"Do different goat breeds show differences in reproductive seasonality, and how does this affect breeding schedules?",Others,"Under Taiwan¡¦s climatic conditions, native goats generally exhibit less pronounced reproductive seasonality than imported breeds, showing estrus and breeding activity throughout most of the year. This reflects their superior adaptation to hot and humid environments. In contrast, imported goats and their crossbreds tend to retain stronger short-day breeding characteristics, with reduced estrus expression and conception rates during the non-breeding season. However, in recent years, climate change has intensified heat stress, making seasonal differences in reproductive performance increasingly evident. Even in native goats, the gap in reproductive efficiency between breeding and non-breeding seasons has widened. In practice, environmental and physiological interventions¡Xsuch as cooling systems, photoperiod manipulation, and hormonal treatments¡Xare often required to induce breeding during the non-breeding season. Nevertheless, reproductive efficiency under these conditions generally remains lower than that observed during the natural breeding season, highlighting the continued influence of seasonal and environmental factors."
17,How should age at first breeding and body condition be determined for native and imported goats raised in Taiwan?,Others,"For both native and imported goats, age at first breeding should be determined primarily by body weight and body condition rather than age alone. It is generally recommended that does reach 60¡V70% of mature body weight with adequate body condition before breeding. Native goats mature earlier but should not be bred too early to avoid compromising growth, while larger imported breeds require sufficient skeletal and nutritional development to reduce the risk of dystocia and reproductive disorders."
18,"Why is crossbreeding between native and imported goats commonly practiced in Taiwan, and how does it affect reproduction and production?",Others,"Crossbreeding between native and imported goats in Taiwan aims to combine desirable traits, such as the environmental adaptability and disease resistance of native goats with the superior growth rate and meat yield of imported breeds. Properly managed crossbreeding can improve production efficiency; however, changes in reproductive performance, nutritional requirements, and environmental tolerance must be carefully monitored to avoid compromising reproductive stability."
19,What are the main differences in body size and reproductive performance between native goats and imported meat-type goats in Taiwan?,Others,"Native goats in Taiwan are generally smaller in body size, mature earlier, and show better adaptation to local climatic conditions, maintaining relatively stable reproductive performance under heat and humidity. However, their growth rate and carcass weight are lower. Imported meat-type goats, such as Boer-derived breeds, have larger body size, faster growth, and higher meat yield, but mature later and require stricter nutritional and environmental management, with reproductive performance more susceptible to heat stress and non-breeding seasons."
20,"When raising goats for the first time, how should breed selection be approached, and what practical factors should be prioritized?",Others,"For first-time goat farmers, breed selection should be based primarily on production goals, rather than whether the breed is native or imported. To reduce initial risk, meat-type goats are generally recommended, as they require less specialized equipment and labor. In contrast, dairy goats involve higher investment in milking equipment, cold storage, hygiene control, and labor, making them less suitable for beginners. Other important considerations include body size, environmental adaptability, and ease of management. Native goats in Taiwan are often considered beginner-friendly due to their smaller size, heat tolerance, and ease of handling. Imported meat-type breeds or their crossbreds offer higher growth and meat yield potential but require more advanced nutritional and environmental management. Ultimately, beginners should select breeds based on available resources, management capacity, and intended production goals."
21,Why can reproductive performance vary greatly among goats of the same breed raised on different farms?,Others,"Even within the same breed, reproductive performance can vary significantly due to differences in management practices, nutrition, environmental conditions, and disease control. Heat stress, poor feed quality, inadequate body condition, or chronic health issues can all reduce estrus expression and conception rates. Breed provides a baseline potential, but management quality ultimately determines reproductive outcomes."
22,"When conserving or selecting breeding goats in Taiwan, how should reproductive indicators be evaluated?",Others,"When conserving or selecting breeding goats, priority should be given to reproductive indicators such as age at first breeding, kidding interval, litter size, history of abortion or dystocia, and estrus expression during the non-breeding season. For bucks, libido, mating success, and offspring performance should be evaluated. These indicators help ensure long-term reproductive capacity and genetic stability of the population."
23,"Where can goats be purchased in Taiwan for breeding or farming purposes, and what should be considered for each source?",Others,"In Taiwan, common sources for purchasing goats include:Licensed livestock auction markets, which provide transparent sourcing and flexible pricing, but require buyers to independently assess health and reproductive background.1.Professional breeding farms or conservation units, suitable for acquiring breeding does or bucks with documented genetic and reproductive records, though usually at higher cost. 2.Government research institutions such as the Livestock Research Institute, where goats offered for transfer typically have well-documented breed background, breeding history, and strict biosecurity management. These sources are particularly suitable for breeding, conservation, or research purposes, although availability often depends on official announcements or application-based programs rather than immediate purchase. 3.Private transfers from other farms, which may be more flexible and affordable but carry higher risks related to disease control and traceability. Regardless of the source, buyers should verify animal health, reproductive history, vaccination and deworming records, and implement quarantine and biosecurity measures after introduction to minimize disease risk."
