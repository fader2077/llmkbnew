1,What emergency measures can farmers take to improve survival when a newborn lamb cannot stand or suckle on its own?,Health & Disease Control,"When a newborn goat kid is too weak to stand or suckle, immediate human assistance is required. Farmers should help the kid stand and guide its mouth to the doe’s teat to stimulate the suckling reflex. If suckling remains difficult, colostrum can be fed using a bottle, along with vitamin solutions, sugar water, or energy supplements to increase energy levels. Thiamine injection may also enhance vitality. If the kid still cannot feed, a veterinarian should be consulted to perform stomach tube feeding with colostrum to ensure adequate early nutrition."
2,"What are the three major causes of mortality in newborn lambs, and how should hypothermia be managed in emergency situations?",Health & Disease Control,"The three major life-threatening problems for newborn goat kids are inability to feed independently, insufficient milk supply from the doe, and hypothermia. Hypothermia commonly occurs in cold or damp environments, especially in premature or weak kids. Emergency treatment includes drying the kid immediately and placing it close to the human body to reduce heat loss. In severe cases, the kid can be immersed in warm water with the head kept above the surface to rapidly raise body temperature, followed by thorough drying and continued warming. Heat lamps are commonly used in less severe cases."
3,"Why are young goats more susceptible to clinical disease caused by Moniezia spp. infection than adult goats, and what are the common clinical signs?",Health & Disease Control,"Adult goats infected with Moniezia spp. usually show mild or no clinical signs, whereas young goats are more susceptible due to immature intestinal development and higher nutritional requirements. The movement of the tapeworm within the small intestine irritates the intestinal mucosa, and parasite metabolic by-products further impair digestion and nutrient absorption. Common clinical signs include reduced appetite, digestive disorders, anemia, growth retardation, weight loss, abdominal distension, and edema. Severe infections may result in death. Goats younger than eight months are therefore considered a high-risk group."
4,"What is the life cycle of tapeworm infection in goats, and what farm management practices can reduce the risk of infection?",Health & Disease Control,"Common tapeworms infecting goats, such as Moniezia expansa and Moniezia benedeni, use oribatid mites as intermediate hosts. Goats become infected when they ingest mites containing infective larvae during grazing. Oribatid mites are commonly found in moist pasture and surface soil, making environmental conditions a major risk factor. Farm management strategies include avoiding grazing after rainfall or during early mornings when dew is present, implementing routine deworming programs (approximately 2–4 times per year), and promptly treating heavily infected goats followed by a second treatment two weeks later to reduce egg shedding and reinfection."
5,"Why does abortion caused by Chlamydophila abortus in goats usually occur during mid to late pregnancy, and what is the main pathological mechanism?",Health & Disease Control,"After initial infection, goats infected with Chlamydophila abortus usually show only mild and transient clinical signs, followed by a latent infection stage in which the pathogen persists in the uterine mucosa. During mid to late pregnancy (around day 115 of gestation), the bacteria become reactivated and replicate rapidly, causing severe necrotizing placentitis. This results in necrosis of placental cotyledons, impaired nutrient and oxygen transfer to the fetus, and ultimately fetal death, abortion, or stillbirth. Some does may show blood-tinged vaginal discharge 2–3 days before abortion, and retained placenta may also occur."
6,"What are the main transmission routes of Chlamydophila abortus in goat herds, and what zoonotic risks should farm workers be aware of when handling abortion cases?",Health & Disease Control,"Chlamydophila abortus is mainly transmitted through oral or nasal contact with contaminated aborted fetuses, placentas, fetal fluids, newborn kids, or uterine discharges, and may also spread via aerosolized particles. After abortion, infected does can continue shedding the bacteria through the reproductive tract for several weeks. Even if subsequent pregnancies appear normal, these animals may remain a source of environmental contamination. Because C. abortus is a significant zoonotic pathogen, farm workers handling abortion materials without proper protection may develop flu-like symptoms. The risk is particularly serious for pregnant women, as infection may cause placentitis and lead to abortion or stillbirth. Therefore, abortion cases should be managed by isolating affected does, using appropriate personal protective equipment, thorough disinfection, and ensuring that pregnant personnel do not handle aborted materials."
7,What disease risks are most likely to occur if newborn goat kids do not receive adequate colostrum?,Health & Disease Control,"Newborn goat kids have immature immune systems and rely on colostrum to obtain maternal antibodies. Insufficient colostrum intake shortly after birth greatly reduces resistance to environmental pathogens, increasing the risk of diarrhea, respiratory disease, and mortality."
8,What infection risks may newborn goat kids face when kidding area hygiene is poor?,Health & Disease Control,"Dirty or damp kidding areas increase the likelihood of pathogen exposure through the mouth, nose, or umbilicus. Maintaining clean and dry environments is a key measure for reducing neonatal disease risk."
9,Why do diseases often accumulate gradually under poor management rather than appearing suddenly?,Health & Disease Control,"Poor management causes chronic stress—such as overcrowding, poor ventilation, or inadequate nutrition—which first reduces feed intake and immunity. Disease develops gradually and often affects productivity before obvious clinical signs appear."
10,Why are young goats considered a high-risk group in disease risk assessment?,Health & Disease Control,"Young goats have immature immune systems, higher nutritional demands, and greater sensitivity to environmental changes, making them more susceptible to disease under suboptimal management."
11,How does prolonged environmental moisture increase disease risk on goat farms?,Health & Disease Control,"High moisture favors pathogen and parasite survival and leads to damp housing conditions, increasing the risk of hoof problems, parasitic infections, and respiratory disease."
12,Why do disease and stress problems often worsen simultaneously under excessive stocking density?,Health & Disease Control,"High stocking density increases competition and social stress while facilitating pathogen transmission, causing disease and stress to reinforce each other.Some diseases have incubation periods, and outwardly healthy goats may still carry pathogens. Isolation prevents introduction of disease into the existing herd."
13,What hidden disease risks may be introduced if newly purchased goats are not properly isolated?,Health & Disease Control,"Some diseases have incubation periods, and outwardly healthy goats may still carry pathogens. Isolation prevents introduction of disease into the existing herd."
14,"When similar diseases recur on a farm, what management-related problems are commonly indicated?",Health & Disease Control,"Without improvement in environment, density, or nutrition, disease can recur even with the same pathogen, indicating that management conditions sustain disease risk."
15,How does poor ventilation gradually increase the risk of respiratory disease in goats?,Health & Disease Control,"Poor ventilation allows moisture, dust, and irritant gases to accumulate, chronically irritating the respiratory tract and increasing disease susceptibility."
16,Why should weaker or subordinate goats receive special attention during early disease detection?,Health & Disease Control,"Subordinate goats experience greater stress and reduced feed access, so their nutritional and immune status declines first, making them early indicators of disease."
17,"What disease and biosecurity risks may arise if aborted fetuses, placentas, and discharges are not properly handled?",Health & Disease Control,"These materials may contain high pathogen loads and can contaminate the environment, posing infection risks to both goats and farm workers."
18,Why is medication alone often ineffective on farms experiencing recurring disease problems?,Health & Disease Control,"Without addressing environmental, density, or hygiene issues, pathogen pressure remains, and medication provides only temporary relief rather than long-term control."
19,How does long-term stress affect disease occurrence in goats?,Health & Disease Control,Chronic stress suppresses immune function and reduces resistance to pathogens. Stable management helps maintain immunity and prevent disease.
20,Why does inconsistent daily management increase overall disease risk over time?,Health & Disease Control,"Inconsistent feeding, grouping, or handling repeatedly creates stress and increases disease risk. Consistent management supports long-term herd health."
21,"What are the advantages and disadvantages of confinement feeding versus grazing for goats in Taiwan, and how should farmers choose between them?",Management & Housing,"In Taiwan, both confinement feeding and grazing systems have their advantages. Confinement allows better control of nutrition, health, and reproduction, making it suitable for medium to large farms or operations requiring precise management, although feed and facility costs are higher. Grazing can reduce feed costs and allow natural foraging behavior but requires sufficient land and increases exposure to parasites and weather-related risks. The choice should be based on farm size, land availability, labor capacity, and management goals."
22,What are the key considerations for goat housing design under Taiwan’s hot and humid climate?,Management & Housing,"Under Taiwan’s hot and humid conditions, ventilation, cooling, and moisture control are critical in goat housing design. Good natural airflow or mechanical ventilation helps reduce heat stress. High roofs, open-sided structures, and adequate shade improve heat dissipation. Dry flooring and proper drainage are essential to prevent hoof problems and parasite buildup. Well-designed housing directly affects feed intake, reproductive performance, and overall health."
23,"What problems can arise from excessive stocking density in goats, and how should grouping be managed?",Management & Housing,"Excessive stocking density can lead to increased competition for feed, higher stress levels, faster disease transmission, and reduced reproductive performance. Grouping goats by sex, age, and physiological status (such as pregnancy or lactation) helps reduce competition and improves management efficiency. Appropriate stocking density and grouping support herd stability, reduce injuries, and enhance productivity."
24,What early warning signs should caretakers look for during daily goat herd inspections?,Management & Housing,"During daily inspections, caretakers should observe feeding behavior, alertness, mobility, and fecal consistency. Reduced appetite, isolation from the group, lameness, abnormal breathing, or changes in feces often indicate early health or management issues. Early detection allows timely intervention, reducing disease spread and production losses."
25,"Why is management closely linked to reproductive performance in goats, and which management factors have the greatest impact?",Management & Housing,"Management directly affects body condition, stress levels, and overall health, all of which are critical for normal estrus expression, conception, and kidding outcomes. Poor management often leads to subtle but chronic stress, which suppresses reproductive hormones before obvious clinical disease appears. Key management factors influencing reproduction include adequate and stage-appropriate nutrition, heat stress control, appropriate stocking density, stable social grouping, and effective disease and parasite prevention. Reproductive performance therefore reflects the cumulative quality of daily management rather than a single intervention."
26,Why does poor environmental management often reduce feed intake before obvious disease appears?,Management & Housing,"Goats are highly sensitive to environmental changes. Heat, humidity, and poor ventilation cause stress responses that first reduce feed intake. If not corrected, prolonged stress may later lead to immune suppression and disease."
27,Why should frequent regrouping or major management operations be avoided during hot seasons?,Management & Housing,"Regrouping and handling are stressful events. During hot seasons, these stresses compound heat stress, reducing feed intake, impairing reproduction, and increasing disease risk."
28,What indicators can be used to assess the effectiveness of improved barn ventilation?,Management & Housing,"Effective ventilation improvement is indicated by reduced respiration rate, less panting, improved feed intake, increased activity, and more even herd distribution."
29,Why are wet and manure-covered floors often underestimated in their long-term impact?,Management & Housing,"Although short-term effects may be subtle, wet and dirty floors increase long-term risks of hoof problems, parasites, and bacterial infections, reducing growth and reproductive performance."
30,How can caretakers distinguish between environmental stress and early disease signs causing lethargy?,Management & Housing,"Environmental stress usually affects many animals simultaneously, whereas disease typically appears in individual animals with additional signs such as fever or appetite loss."
31,Why is standardized management important even in small-scale goat farms?,Management & Housing,"Standardized procedures reduce human error and variability, ensuring consistent management and improving disease prevention and productivity."
32,What management risks are most commonly overlooked in herds with multiple breeds or sources?,Management & Housing,"In multi-breed or multi-source herds, risks extend beyond disease introduction. Different breeds and sources may vary in environmental adaptation, social behavior, nutritional needs, and reproductive timing. Without careful grouping and management, these differences can lead to competition, uneven feed intake, stress, and inconsistent reproductive performance. Overlooking adaptation and management compatibility often results in long-term inefficiencies even when no acute disease is present."
33,Why should newly introduced goats be isolated even if they appear healthy?,Management & Housing,Some diseases have incubation periods. Isolation helps prevent introducing infections into the herd even when goats appear healthy.
34,Which routine practices most commonly increase stress unintentionally in goats?,Management & Housing,"Many stressors arise from routine practices that appear minor to caretakers but are significant to goats. Sudden feed changes, frequent regrouping, unnecessary handling, prolonged chasing, and working animals during hot periods disrupt social stability and increase physiological stress. Because goats often do not show immediate illness, these stressors are easily underestimated, yet they can quietly reduce feed intake, immunity, and reproductive performance over time."
35,Why must the same management system be adjusted seasonally?,Management & Housing,"Seasonal changes affect temperature, humidity, and disease risks, requiring management adjustments to maintain herd stability."
36,When should environmental improvement be prioritized over medication use?,Management & Housing,"When issues stem from ventilation, density, or hygiene, medication alone cannot solve the problem; environmental improvement is more effective long-term."
37,Why are subordinate goats early indicators of management quality?,Management & Housing,"Subordinate goats experience competition and stress earlier and more intensely than dominant animals. When management is suboptimal—such as inadequate feeder space, poor grouping, or heat stress—these goats show reduced feed intake, slower growth, or weaker reproductive performance first. Monitoring subordinate animals provides an early warning of management problems that may not yet be apparent in the herd average."
38,What hidden problems can arise from overly enclosed goat housing?,Management & Housing,"Overly enclosed housing may appear clean and well-controlled but often restricts air exchange, leading to high humidity, ammonia buildup, and poor heat dissipation. These conditions increase respiratory stress, suppress immunity, and reduce feed intake long before obvious disease occurs. In hot and humid climates, insufficient ventilation can be more harmful than exposure to moderate external weather conditions"
39,Why does record-keeping reduce management decision errors?,Management & Housing,"Records provide objective data, reducing reliance on memory and helping identify problems and evaluate management outcomes."
40,How does management stability affect a farm’s long-term risk tolerance?,Management & Housing,"Stable management reduces fluctuations in stress, health, and reproductive performance, allowing farms to better absorb environmental, climatic, and market risks. In contrast, frequent changes in routines, housing, or feeding increase variability and vulnerability. Farms with consistent management systems are more resilient, experience fewer reproductive failures, and can adapt more effectively to long-term challenges such as climate change."
41,"Why should forage selection for goats consider not only nutrient composition, but also feeding behavior and forage quality?",Nutrition & Feeding,"Goats are classified as “browse-type” animals and generally prefer leaves and legume forages over grasses. Studies show that goats exhibit large differences in intake depending on forage quality, particularly digestibility. Even when nutrient compositions appear similar, forages with lower organic matter digestibility or higher NDF and ADF contents significantly reduce voluntary intake. Therefore, ignoring feeding behavior and forage preference and relying solely on nutrient values may result in reduced intake, insufficient nutrient consumption, and ultimately poorer health and production performance."
42,How should feeding and nutritional management be adjusted for goats during late pregnancy or under heat stress conditions?,Nutrition & Feeding,"During late pregnancy, especially in twin-bearing does, energy and protein requirements increase by approximately 30% and 44%, respectively. However, fetal growth reduces rumen capacity, limiting feed intake. As a result, nutritional needs cannot be met by increased intake alone. Practical strategies include increasing dietary nutrient density by raising concentrate proportions or using forages with higher protein content and digestibility to supply more digestible nutrients per unit of intake. Under heat stress conditions, high temperatures significantly reduce dry matter and NDF intake while increasing body temperature and respiration rate. In addition to cooling strategies such as misting and ventilation, dietary adjustments are necessary. These include reducing forage proportion or replacing high-NDF forages with lower-NDF alternatives to decrease rumen heat production, thereby improving intake and productive performance such as milk yield or weight gain."
43,Why is nutritional management the foundation of goat productivity?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Nutrition is the foundation of goat productivity, directly affecting feed intake, body condition, immune function, and reproduction. Even with good genetics and management, insufficient energy or protein limits growth, milk production, and conception. Long-term imbalance also increases disease risk and reduces production stability."
44,Why do goats require forage rather than concentrate-only diets?,Nutrition & Feeding,Forage maintains rumen function and normal rumination. Excessive concentrate feeding increases the risk of rumen acidosis.
45,Why do goats require different diets at different physiological stages?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Energy and protein requirements differ greatly among pregnancy, lactation, and growth stages. Improper diets lead to poor condition and productivity."
46,Why are late-pregnant does especially prone to nutritional deficiency?,Nutrition & Feeding,"During late pregnancy, fetal growth accelerates, greatly increasing energy and protein requirements. At the same time, the expanding uterus reduces rumen capacity, limiting feed intake. Without increasing dietary nutrient density, nutrient deficits may occur, leading to poor body condition, reduced milk yield, dystocia, and lower kid survival."
47,What nutritional considerations are important during hot seasons in Taiwan?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Heat stress significantly reduces feed intake in goats. Diets should avoid excessive fiber and low digestibility feeds, while improving palatability and nutrient density. Adequate clean water supply is essential; otherwise productivity declines even if feed is sufficient."
48,Why are goats particularly sensitive to forage quality changes?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Goats are selective feeders and respond strongly to digestibility and palatability, leading to rapid intake changes."
49,What problems can result from excessive dietary fiber?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Excessive dietary fiber increases rumen fill and limits intake, reducing energy supply. This is especially detrimental during lactation and reproduction, leading to poor growth, reduced milk yield, and weak estrus expression. High fiber does not always mean adequate nutrition."
50,Why does excessive concentrate feeding also pose risks?,Nutrition & Feeding,"High concentrate diets accelerate rumen fermentation, lowering rumen pH and increasing the risk of acidosis. This can destabilize intake, cause hoof and metabolic problems, and reduce milk fat. Concentrates should supplement, not replace, forage."
51,Why is water management part of nutritional management?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Insufficient water intake directly reduces feed intake and digestion, especially under heat stress."
52,Why does sudden diet change cause problems in goats?,Nutrition & Feeding,Rumen microbes require adaptation time; sudden changes disrupt digestion and intake.
53,Why does nutritional deficiency often affect reproduction before growth?,Nutrition & Feeding,"When nutrients are limited, goats prioritize survival and basic functions. Reproduction, being non-essential, is suppressed first, resulting in delayed or weak estrus and ovulatory issues. Many apparent reproductive problems originate from nutritional deficiencies."
54,Why is body condition scoring an important nutritional tool?,Nutrition & Feeding,Body condition reflects long-term energy balance better than short-term intake measurements.
55,Why should diets not be evaluated by crude protein alone?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Crude protein indicates quantity, not utilization. Without sufficient energy, protein cannot be efficiently used and may increase metabolic burden. Diet formulation must consider energy balance, protein source, and digestibility."
56,Why are high-producing lactating goats especially sensitive to nutrition?,Nutrition & Feeding,Lactation has high energy demands; small deficiencies quickly reduce milk yield and condition.
57,How can overfeeding be avoided in practice?,Nutrition & Feeding,Grouping goats by physiological stage prevents overfeeding and metabolic issues.
58,Why do nutritional and management problems often occur together?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Poor management reduces intake and digestion, turning adequate diets into functional deficiencies."
59,Why should feed costs be evaluated on a dry matter basis?,Nutrition & Feeding,Dry matter basis allows accurate comparison of nutrient content and cost among feeds.
60,Why are imported feeds not always superior to local feeds?,Nutrition & Feeding,High cost or variable quality may reduce the cost-effectiveness of imported feeds.
61,Why must nutrition be aligned with reproductive planning?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Nutritional requirements change markedly around breeding and kidding. Without timely dietary adjustments, conception and postpartum recovery suffer. Aligning nutrition with reproductive planning improves efficiency and doe health."
62,What long-term benefits result from good nutritional management?,Nutrition & Feeding,"Good nutrition improves stability, reduces disease and waste, and enhances return on investment."
63,"What are the common native goat breeds raised in Taiwan, and what are their main reproductive and utilization characteristics?",Breeding & Reproduction,"The most common native goat breed raised in Taiwan is the Taiwan Black Goat, which includes several regional populations. Native goats are well adapted to Taiwan’s hot and humid climate, show good disease resistance, and can efficiently utilize roughage. Their reproductive activity is relatively seasonal, with higher estrus expression during autumn and winter. Although they have smaller body size and slower growth rates, their meat quality is highly valued for local production and genetic conservation."
64,"What are the major imported or improved goat breeds raised in Taiwan, and what reproductive management considerations are important for these breeds?",Breeding & Reproduction,"Common imported or improved goat breeds in Taiwan include Boer goats and their crossbreds, which are mainly used for meat production improvement. These breeds have larger body size, faster growth, and higher meat yield, but they are more sensitive to heat and humidity. Their reproductive performance can be negatively affected by heat stress. Proper nutritional management, body condition control, and heat mitigation strategies are essential to maintain good estrus expression and conception rates."
65,"Do different goat breeds show differences in reproductive seasonality, and how does this affect breeding schedules?",Breeding & Reproduction,"Under Taiwan’s climatic conditions, native goats generally exhibit less pronounced reproductive seasonality than imported breeds, showing estrus and breeding activity throughout most of the year. This reflects their superior adaptation to hot and humid environments. In contrast, imported goats and their crossbreds tend to retain stronger short-day breeding characteristics, with reduced estrus expression and conception rates during the non-breeding season. However, in recent years, climate change has intensified heat stress, making seasonal differences in reproductive performance increasingly evident. Even in native goats, the gap in reproductive efficiency between breeding and non-breeding seasons has widened. In practice, environmental and physiological interventions—such as cooling systems, photoperiod manipulation, and hormonal treatments—are often required to induce breeding during the non-breeding season. Nevertheless, reproductive efficiency under these conditions generally remains lower than that observed during the natural breeding season, highlighting the continued influence of seasonal and environmental factors."
66,How should age at first breeding and body condition be determined for native and imported goats raised in Taiwan?,Breeding & Reproduction,"For both native and imported goats, age at first breeding should be determined primarily by body weight and body condition rather than age alone. It is generally recommended that does reach 60–70% of mature body weight with adequate body condition before breeding. Native goats mature earlier but should not be bred too early to avoid compromising growth, while larger imported breeds require sufficient skeletal and nutritional development to reduce the risk of dystocia and reproductive disorders."
67,"Why is crossbreeding between native and imported goats commonly practiced in Taiwan, and how does it affect reproduction and production?",Breeding & Reproduction,"Crossbreeding between native and imported goats in Taiwan aims to combine desirable traits, such as the environmental adaptability and disease resistance of native goats with the superior growth rate and meat yield of imported breeds. Properly managed crossbreeding can improve production efficiency; however, changes in reproductive performance, nutritional requirements, and environmental tolerance must be carefully monitored to avoid compromising reproductive stability."
68,What are the main differences in body size and reproductive performance between native goats and imported meat-type goats in Taiwan?,Breeding & Reproduction,"Native goats in Taiwan are generally smaller in body size, mature earlier, and show better adaptation to local climatic conditions, maintaining relatively stable reproductive performance under heat and humidity. However, their growth rate and carcass weight are lower. Imported meat-type goats, such as Boer-derived breeds, have larger body size, faster growth, and higher meat yield, but mature later and require stricter nutritional and environmental management, with reproductive performance more susceptible to heat stress and non-breeding seasons."
69,"When raising goats for the first time, how should breed selection be approached, and what practical factors should be prioritized?",Breeding & Reproduction,"For first-time goat farmers, breed selection should be based primarily on production goals, rather than whether the breed is native or imported. To reduce initial risk, meat-type goats are generally recommended, as they require less specialized equipment and labor. In contrast, dairy goats involve higher investment in milking equipment, cold storage, hygiene control, and labor, making them less suitable for beginners. Other important considerations include body size, environmental adaptability, and ease of management. Native goats in Taiwan are often considered beginner-friendly due to their smaller size, heat tolerance, and ease of handling. Imported meat-type breeds or their crossbreds offer higher growth and meat yield potential but require more advanced nutritional and environmental management. Ultimately, beginners should select breeds based on available resources, management capacity, and intended production goals."
70,Why can reproductive performance vary greatly among goats of the same breed raised on different farms?,Breeding & Reproduction,"Even within the same breed, reproductive performance can vary significantly due to differences in management practices, nutrition, environmental conditions, and disease control. Heat stress, poor feed quality, inadequate body condition, or chronic health issues can all reduce estrus expression and conception rates. Breed provides a baseline potential, but management quality ultimately determines reproductive outcomes."
71,"When conserving or selecting breeding goats in Taiwan, how should reproductive indicators be evaluated?",Breeding & Reproduction,"When conserving or selecting breeding goats, priority should be given to reproductive indicators such as age at first breeding, kidding interval, litter size, history of abortion or dystocia, and estrus expression during the non-breeding season. For bucks, libido, mating success, and offspring performance should be evaluated. These indicators help ensure long-term reproductive capacity and genetic stability of the population."
72,"Where can goats be purchased in Taiwan for breeding or farming purposes, and what should be considered for each source?",Breeding & Reproduction,"In Taiwan, common sources for purchasing goats include:Licensed livestock auction markets, which provide transparent sourcing and flexible pricing, but require buyers to independently assess health and reproductive background.1.Professional breeding farms or conservation units, suitable for acquiring breeding does or bucks with documented genetic and reproductive records, though usually at higher cost. 2.Government research institutions such as the Livestock Research Institute, where goats offered for transfer typically have well-documented breed background, breeding history, and strict biosecurity management. These sources are particularly suitable for breeding, conservation, or research purposes, although availability often depends on official announcements or application-based programs rather than immediate purchase. 3.Private transfers from other farms, which may be more flexible and affordable but carry higher risks related to disease control and traceability. Regardless of the source, buyers should verify animal health, reproductive history, vaccination and deworming records, and implement quarantine and biosecurity measures after introduction to minimize disease risk."
73,"Under Taiwan’s conditions, when is it necessary to adjust reproductive management strategies for different goat breeds?",Breeding & Reproduction,"Adjustments are required under heat stress, increased off-season breeding demand, or when introducing imported or crossbred goats. Breed-specific sensitivity to heat and seasonality affects estrus expression and conception if not properly managed."
74,Why can the same reproductive techniques produce different results in different goat breeds?,Breeding & Reproduction,"Breeds differ in endocrine responses, seasonality, body size, and nutritional requirements. Therefore, identical synchronization or breeding techniques may yield different outcomes depending on breed-specific characteristics and management conditions."
75,Why is breed selection particularly important for off-season breeding?,Breeding & Reproduction,"Breed differences in estrus expression and fertility are amplified during the non-breeding season. Native goats tend to maintain baseline reproductive activity, while imported breeds often require environmental or hormonal intervention to achieve acceptable efficiency."
76,Why does body size difference influence reproductive risks among goat breeds?,Breeding & Reproduction,Larger breeds face higher risks of dystocia and poor postpartum recovery if bred too early or under poor nutrition. Smaller breeds are easier to kid but may suffer growth impairment if bred prematurely. Body size must be considered in risk management.
77,How can unstable reproductive performance be avoided in crossbred goat herds?,Breeding & Reproduction,"Crossbred herds may show greater variability across generations. Controlled selection based on estrus expression, litter size, and maternal traits is essential; otherwise, reproductive stability may decline over time."
78,Why should reproductive failure not be attributed solely to breed?,Breeding & Reproduction,"Breed defines potential, but actual reproductive outcomes are strongly influenced by nutrition, environment, health, and management. Overattributing failure to breed may overlook correctable management issues."
79,"When introducing new breeding goats, what reproductive risks should be evaluated beyond breed?",Breeding & Reproduction,"Beyond breed, reproductive history, age, body condition, disease status, and source farm abortion risk should be evaluated. Ignoring these factors can rapidly compromise herd reproduction."
80,Why does breed adaptability influence long-term reproductive stability?,Breeding & Reproduction,"Breeds adapted to local conditions maintain stable estrus and conception under environmental fluctuations, while poorly adapted breeds require continuous, costly interventions to sustain reproduction."
81,How should breed composition be planned when setting reproductive goals for a farm?,Breeding & Reproduction,"Breed composition should align with farm goals, such as stable kid supply, meat production, or conservation. Single goals suit single breeds, while mixed goals require structured breed combinations and group management."
82,"Under Taiwan’s conditions, how can suitability of a breed for long-term reproduction be evaluated?",Breeding & Reproduction,"Suitability should be evaluated based on conception rate, kidding stability, health, and management cost under local conditions, not short-term productivity alone. Breeds requiring less intervention for stable reproduction are better suited long term."
83,Why should production efficiency be evaluated together with management costs rather than production output alone?,Production & Farm Econ,"High production accompanied by high feed, labor, or medical costs may reduce actual profit. Production efficiency should be evaluated based on net returns per unit of input, not output alone."
84,Why is stable production often more beneficial than short-term high output for farm management?,Production & Farm Econ,"Stable production reduces risks from disease, reproductive failure, and market fluctuations, making costs and cash flow more predictable and often more profitable long term."
85,Why are meat goats generally recommended over dairy goats for beginners in Taiwan?,Production & Farm Econ,"Dairy goats require milking equipment, cold storage, hygiene control, and intensive labor, increasing entry barriers. Meat goats are simpler to manage and better suited for beginners."
86,Why should goat farms avoid rapid expansion at the initial stage?,Production & Farm Econ,"Rapid expansion can exceed management and labor capacity, increasing disease, reproductive failure, and cost overruns. Gradual scaling helps maintain management quality."
87,Why is reproductive efficiency a key indicator of farm profitability?,Production & Farm Econ,Reproductive efficiency directly determines the number of marketable kids and production cycles. Low conception or survival rates increase unit costs and reduce profitability.
88,Why is feed cost the most critical expense to monitor on goat farms?,Production & Farm Econ,Feed costs usually represent the largest portion of total expenses and are sensitive to market fluctuations. Even small changes can significantly affect profit.
89,Why does producing forage on-farm not always reduce overall costs?,Production & Farm Econ,"On-farm forage production requires land, labor, machinery, and management. If yield or quality is inconsistent, costs may exceed purchased feed."
90,Why does labor allocation directly affect farm management risk?,Production & Farm Econ,Insufficient labor or reliance on a single individual increases the risk of management gaps and delayed responses to emergencies.
91,Why is record-keeping more important for management than commonly expected?,Production & Farm Econ,"Records allow tracking of costs, reproduction, and disease trends, reducing reliance on memory and enabling timely management adjustments."
92,Why do market price fluctuations amplify losses caused by poor management?,Production & Farm Econ,"When prices drop, high costs and inefficiencies from poor management become more pronounced, reducing the farm’s ability to absorb market shocks."
93,Why should production efficiency be evaluated annually rather than per batch?,Production & Farm Econ,"Single batches are affected by random factors, while annual evaluation better reflects overall management quality and long-term trends."
94,Why is disease prevention more cost-effective than treatment?,Production & Farm Econ,"Treatment incurs medical costs and productivity losses, whereas prevention reduces both direct and indirect economic losses."
95,Why do diversified income sources improve farm stability?,Production & Farm Econ,"Diversified income spreads production and market risks, reducing dependence on a single product."
96,Why should equipment investment match farm scale?,Production & Farm Econ,Overinvestment increases depreciation and maintenance costs that may not be recovered at smaller scales.
97,Why does simplified management improve overall efficiency?,Production & Farm Econ,Complex systems increase error rates and labor burden. Simplified management reduces mistakes and improves consistency.
98,Why has climate change become a critical factor in farm management?,Production & Farm Econ,"Heat and extreme weather affect feed intake, reproduction, and disease risk, directly impacting productivity if management is not adjusted."
99,Why does risk management not necessarily mean reducing production?,Production & Farm Econ,"Risk management focuses on controlling variability and losses, not suppressing output. Stable production supports long-term profit."
100,Why do cooperation and information exchange improve farm efficiency?,Production & Farm Econ,Information exchange reduces trial-and-error costs and allows earlier adoption of effective practices.
101,Why should management decisions not rely on a single year’s performance?,Production & Farm Econ,Single-year results may be distorted by weather or market conditions; long-term trends better reflect true performance.
102,What type of management model best supports long-term sustainability of goat farms?,Production & Farm Econ,"Management models emphasizing stability, cost control, risk diversification, and gradual growth best support long-term sustainability."
